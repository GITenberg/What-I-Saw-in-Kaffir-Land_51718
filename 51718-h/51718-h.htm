<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This book contains extracts from the daily
record of impressions made on my mind, by
men and events, as we performed together our
allotted parts, in one short tragical episode at
the Cape. Very little has been omitted; nothing
has been added. It is a simple narrative, taken
from the Book of my Life, of which, if it is not
the opening chapter, it is at least one of the
first.</p>

<p>If by my observations I have hurt any one’s
feelings, this may have been caused by these
persons having ruffled mine. If I have said but
little good of any one with whom I have been
brought into contact, it is because I failed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
perceive any more than I have mentioned.
The reader will be able to some extent to judge
whether or not this has arisen from my want of
perspicacity, or from their incapacity.</p>

<p>I can only add, that this narrative is true.
I have thought, in having it published, that it
might interest those who seek by reading some
information about the realities of life in this
artificial world of ours, wherein time-serving
hypocrites present themselves so often as shams
when Heaven and country call for men.

<p class="ph1">WHAT I SAW IN KAFFIR-LAND.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="hang">ATTACHED TO THE FRENCH MILITARY STAFF IN ALGERIA&mdash;THE
MINIE RIFLE&mdash;INTERVIEWS WITH THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON
AND OTHERS&mdash;WAR AT THE CAPE&mdash;I OFFER MY SERVICES&mdash;RED-TAPE
DIFFICULTIES&mdash;START FOR THE CAPE.</p>

<p>In the year 1847 I was attached to the French
staff in Algeria, and during several expeditions,
both against Arabs and Kabyles, I became deeply
impressed with the great superiority of the Minie
rifle over the old smooth-bore. On my return
to England I did all I could to enforce on the
military authorities the advantages of this new
weapon.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington gave me to understand,
in several interviews he honoured me
with, that he was perfectly satisfied as to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
principle on which the Minie was constructed,
but hesitated in giving effect to this opinion,
on the conviction that the rapid twist of the
rifling would so increase the recoil as to render
this new weapon useless to the British soldier.</p>

<p>His Grace frequently observed, “Englishmen
take aim, Frenchmen fire anyhow;” and no man
could stand fairly up to harder kicking than old
Brown Bess already gave.</p>

<p>General Browne, to whom the Duke handed
me over for any further information I might
have to impart, thought, after lengthened investigation,
that the weapon was a good one for
taking long shots from ramparts, but scouted
the idea that it would ever be useful for active
service in the field.</p>

<p>Colonel Airey, to whom General Browne confided
me, asked if the Duke had really examined
the gun; and on my assuring him that he had
done so on several occasions, expressed his surprise
at his Grace’s having had so much patience.
This naturally brought my interviews to a close
with the military authorities.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the war broke out at the
Cape, and the British army was, as usual, being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
kneaded into shape. The process, however, was
so disintegrating, that the authorities at home
were anxiously looking out for fresh food for
powder. I therefore volunteered my services,
under the condition that the men that served
under me should have the Minie rifle. After
much consideration, I was kindly told that I
might order two hundred rifles at my own
expense; and the military authorities would
allow me to enlist two hundred volunteers&mdash;also
at my own expense&mdash;and afterwards give
us a free passage to the Cape, to go and shoot,
and be shot at by, the Kaffirs.</p>

<p>I accepted the offer as to the rifles, but
declined to enlist the men in England. I
need not say, that having no staff to aid me
in enlisting, and no barracks to put the men
in, the task was impossible. It was finally
agreed that I was to engage the men at the
Cape, and clothe them, the Government giving
rations and pay as in the army.</p>

<p>I at once ordered fifty double-barrelled rifles
of Messrs Barnett &amp; Sons, Tower Hill, London,
and one hundred and fifty single barrels on the
same principle, of Messrs Hall, Birmingham.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
The rifles were soon ready; but the military
authorities insisted on lengthy trials to burst
them&mdash;to prove, I suppose, that they would be
more dangerous to those who used them than
to those they were used against. The cartridges
also underwent innumerable trials: it
was supposed by long-headed gentlemen at
Woolwich, that the iron caps in the base of
the bullets might be so struck that a spark
could be emitted, the cartridge explode, and
the engineer be hoisted by his own petard.
Colonel P&mdash;&mdash; of the 12th gravely surmised
the possibility of one man communicating the
danger to another; upon which Mr Jeffrey, of
marine-blue fame, laughingly remarked that the
battalion in that case would begin file-firing by
shooting themselves off instead of their firelocks.
These, and other equally reasonable
suppositions, kept me in England, until I began
to fear, from the accounts of slaughter sent home,
that there would not be a Kaffir left to try my
guns upon. However, as I knew from experience
that despatches intended for a public a
long way off were apt to be put in a very trumpet-speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
style, and how that through a little
bit of brass a little puff can make a big noise, I
started for the Cape in the good ship Harbinger,
still in the hopes of proving the usefulness of
this new weapon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="hang">LAND AT ST VINCENT&mdash;SHOOTING EXCURSION ON THE ISLAND&mdash;STRANGE
DREAM&mdash;NARROWLY ESCAPE SHIPWRECK&mdash;ARRIVE AT
SIERRA LEONE&mdash;INTERVIEW WITH THE GOVERNOR&mdash;OFFICIAL
CEREMONIES&mdash;VISIT THE BISHOP&mdash;OFFICIAL INSIGNIA&mdash;ST HELENA&mdash;NEGLECTED
STATE OF THE HOUSE WHERE NAPOLEON DIED.</p>

<p>In the same ship were the newly-appointed
Governor of the Cape, Mr Darling, and a Mr
Macdonald, also recently appointed to the Gambia.
The voyage was pleasant on all sides&mdash;ship,
sea, and passengers&mdash;until we put into the
Isle of St Vincent for coal. Here an event
occurred which I should not relate had I been
merely recording the actions of those around me;
but I write these pages that others may learn
the impulses that guide fellow-beings, who, from
one cause or another, have in turn influenced
many. As the ship was being coaled I had
landed alone, and wandered about, gun in hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
to shoot, if I could, some snipe that were supposed
now and again to visit the island. I
could see nothing remarkable in this elevated
spot but its geographical situation in the volcanic
chain that runs from New Granada to St
Eustache. As for the snipe, I had not the
courage to fire at a poor solitary wanderer like
myself that rose at my feet; so, towards evening,
I returned to the ship, tired with my walk on
this torrid, brick-kiln-looking island, that rose
in layers to the clouds like an altar of earth’s
burnt-offering reeking to the skies.</p>

<p>I had lain down in my berth, and had dozed
off into dreamland, and fancied I saw a woman
standing, much as the Virgin in Raffaele’s
“Assumption” at Dresden, high up between the
ship and the shore, motioning me not to be
afraid. At this moment down rushed the
governor of the Gambia, exclaiming, “For
God’s sake get up! the ship is going ashore!”</p>

<p>I was so much under the influence of the
dream, and assured thereby of Divine protection,
that I told him to take my life-preserver, which
was hanging up in the cabin, and to save himself.
Up he rushed again, life-preserver in hand,

while I lay quietly in my berth, listening to
all the hubbub and trampling of feet on the
deck overhead, until the roar of the breakers
and the cessation of blowing off steam, made
me rather anxious as to whether I was not,
after all, going down. My anxieties soon came
to an end. The governor appeared once more,
saying all danger was over, and thanked me
most warmly for having lent him the life-preserver.
It appeared from his rather excited
account, that after lifting the anchor to start for
Sierra Leone, our next place of call, the rudder-chains
got jammed between decks, and the
steamer was helplessly drifting ashore. The
anchor was then dropped again; but, from some
untoward mismanagement, the chain had been
detached from the capstan, and slipped through
the hawser-holes into the sea, going after the
anchor to the bottom.</p>

<p>In this awful predicament we approached the
rugged shore, when, at the last moment, the
recoil of the heavy seas as they were hurled
back into the deep from the shore, jerked the
rudder-chains free. The good ship Harbinger
answered her helm again, and steamed safely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
away on her mission. The next morning I was
congratulated by all on board for my generous
conduct in giving my life-preserver to Mr
Macdonald (who was rather an elderly personage).
So, besides the nuisance of being thanked
(which is always a bore), to increase my confusion
still more, I knew perfectly well it was
utterly undeserved, for I had felt so thoroughly
sure of Divine protection when I gave the life-preserver
away, that it was evidently useless to
me. I never had the courage while on board
to tell my dream, through fear of the pitying
smiles it would raise; so I passed off, very unwillingly,
for a far braver man than I really was.</p>

<p>On arriving at Sierra Leone, some of us
landed to visit the garrison and pay our respects
to the governor, Colonel O’C&mdash;&mdash;r. The barracks,
on the top of the hill overlooking the
town, were clean and comfortable; and the officers
quite a jolly lot for men stationed in “the
white man’s grave,” as Sierra Leone was then
called. The soldiers were smart, well set up,
strongly-framed negroes, equal I should say, if
well led, to a deal of hard fighting. We found
the governor at home, enjoying his pleasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
quarters in a private residence, with great
equanimity and smiling composure. He was
a soft, oily-looking gentleman, considerably
yellowed by the fierce glare of the town. He
lay on a couch, decked out with white muslin
mosquito-curtains; and gently turning round as
we entered, looked like a lump of yellow butter
floating in a basin of iced water; and we youngsters
were considerably cooled down as we
rushed rather heedlessly into the great man’s
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</em>. He, however, gracefully
ducked his head under the curtains, and waved
a ripple of welcome to us all from his extended
hands. He was evidently accustomed
to unquestioning obedience, so we sat down
without saying a word.</p>

<p>The room was full of niggers. It was something
wonderful to see them clustered round the
bell-shaped muslin curtains of his couch, like
busy black flies on a loaf of white crystallised
sugar. One had managed to thrust his naked
arm, like an antenna, under the folds of the
transparent dome, and with a long, white, horse-tail
fan, was waving mysterious passes around
the yellow, sphinx-shaped head of the presiding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
deity. Other attendants, with solemn, ebony-wooded
heads, were squatting around the place,
tossing up and down their lank arms in the most
bewildering manner. Now and again they
would insert their hands under the arm-pits,
then sharply raise them, and with a whack, extend
their palms upon the wall. I slipped out
of the room, and asked the gallant colonel’s
orderly the meaning of this mystic performance.
“You see, sir,” he said, “those niggers squatting
round the room are waiting to relieve the
others on duty at the colonel’s cot; we makes
’em sit still, for when they goes about they
scents mighty strong, and if they sits quite still
they gets like rancid cocoa-oil; so to make them
as sweet as possible, we orders them to keep
alive, pegged down.” Poor black wretches!
they were writing their misery on the wall, in
a manner quite incomprehensible to the gallant
colonel.</p>

<p>I next paid a visit to the bishop, who gave
me the impression of suffering from a deadly
climate, and great despondency as to the prospects
of converting the heathen&mdash;in fact, he
seemed on the point of leaving his flock in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
world without the prospect of meeting even one
of his black sheep in the next.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Colonel O’C&mdash;&mdash;r returned
our visit, and came on board the Harbinger.
The nimble manner in which he glided up the
ladder of the ship, and presented himself in his
white toggery to our gasping selves, was a riddle,
the solving of which would have melted our
brains in that broiling sun. Had it not been for
the gleam that shone now and then from his
glazed, brown eye, which was like a parched
pea, one might have taken him for an automatic
mummy. The same horse-tail I mentioned as
having been waved over his head while reclining
at home, was now carried by himself; and
in answer to a question put to him by young
K&mdash;&mdash; of the 74th, he explained that it was a
Mandingo emblem of authority, which had the
twofold power of keeping off the flies and keeping
the niggers in awe. When, in after-life, I
became a Turkish Pasha with two tails, I often
used to look up to the sort of barber’s pole on
which was appended the same horse-tail token
of authority, and think of Colonel O’C&mdash;&mdash;r
and the affrighted natives of Sierra Leone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>We now proceeded to St Helena, and visited
the residence in which Napoleon died. I was,
as we all were, much hurt on finding the
neglected state of the building, and of the room
in which that great man breathed his last. It
was filled with broken agricultural tools and
farmyard rubbish; and in the small chamber
in which he had described to Montholon how
kingdoms were lost and won, cackling poultry
were brooding; and that small garden, in which
he had spent so many weary hours, trying to
dig away the cankering sorrows of his troubled
life, was overrun with weeds and scarred with
poultry scrabbings.</p>

<p>And so these small, unplastered, half-raftered
rooms were the meshes of the net which had
held the man-slayer of Europe; and this little
plot of ground, scarce larger than a Cockney’s
flower-bed, all that remained to him who had
given realms away! The contrast was too
great. There was something that clashed
harshly somewhere, and I could not help thinking
that posterity would lay this woful wreck to
England’s charge.

CHAMBERLAIN&mdash;HIS PRESENT OF A SWORD AND ITS SUBSEQUENT
HISTORY IN TURKEY.</p>

<p>We now proceeded in the same pleasant manner
on our way to the Cape, and landed there, after
what was then thought a rapid passage of thirty-five
days. We found the news from the seat of
war was full of the excitement of actual strife,
which was being carried on as fiercely as ever.
Governor Darling, who appeared to me rather
diffident as to his powers of doing good in the
colony, with the instructions he had from the
Home Government, was nevertheless very active
in his efforts to help me. Through his assistance
I was enabled, within twenty-four hours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of landing, to open an enlisting office. He also
stirred up the local authorities and the police to
second my efforts. These, and many other kind
offices of his, for which I never afterwards had
the opportunity of thanking him, I here beg to
acknowledge. He is gone now, and I may seem
very tardy in expressing my gratitude, but perhaps
some of the many who loved him may still
listen to my thanks.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Smith, for whom I had letters from
the Duke of Wellington, in which, amongst other
things, he had kindly said that he <em>believed me
to be a real soldier</em>&mdash;not only had all the resources
of Cape Castle and of the commissariat
department placed at my disposal, but offered
an extra Government bounty of two pounds,
besides the two offered by me, for every man
that enlisted. Poor Sir Harry! Although a
fine soldier of the olden class, equal to almost
any act of gallantry that required no further
intuition than that inspired by actual contact
with the foe, he failed during this war for the
same reasons that rendered Lord Chelmsford
equally unsuccessful during the last. The dual
character of the local Government, it being at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the same time civil and military, places serious,
almost insurmountable, obstacles, in the way of
a commander in the field. On emergencies he
is required to consult the wishes and give way
to the exigencies of both powers. It would
require the capacity and the energy of a Clive
or a Stratford to combine, direct, and successfully
wield such a power.</p>

<p>In the course of a fortnight upwards of fifty
men had joined the corps, and everything promised
well for our success; but now difficulties
as to the clothing and arming occurred. As
the bales were landed from the Harbinger, it
was found that the leather jackets for the men
had become so shrunk, from the extreme heat
in the hold of the ship, that there was no
possible means of restoring them to their
original shape. The cartridges also had been
reduced by water to a mealy pulp, stuck over
here and there by pieces of oily white paper
like suet in a black pudding. It appeared
that the idea of the cartridges being of a
highly inflammable nature had pursued the
Woolwich authorities so far, that, out of consideration
for the safety of the ship and its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
precious freight, some considerate souls at the
dockyard had filled the tin cases, in which the
cartridges were packed, <em>with water</em>, and then
carefully soldered them down.</p>

<p>An enterprising clothier, named Taylour,
undertook to make other jackets of a similar
nature to those spoiled; and a most intelligent
mechanic (a Mr Rawbone, gunsmith of Cape
Town) engaged to replace the Minie bullet by
another equally effective.</p>

<p>It was an absolute necessity to make another-shaped
bullet, as the original Minie was useless
without the socket of condensed paper, which I
could not procure in the colony. Putting our
heads together, we invented a bullet in two
unequal sizes, slightly dovetailed together in
the centre, and which, under the concussion of
lighted gunpowder, were driven into one another,
and thus expanding, filled up the grooves
of the rifle, took the twist, and went spinning
through the air on its axis, as true in its flight
as the Minie. I was also greatly aided by a Mr
Andersen, a Norwegian gentleman, an enthusiastic
sportsman and traveller, at the Cape. He
took an almost passionate interest in me, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
task, and the Minie rifle. From him I gained
much useful information concerning bush-life,
and the habits, history, and traditions of the
Kaffir tribes. He had very little faith in the
half-worldly, half-sentimental policy of the
British Government towards the Kaffir and the
Dutch settler; and my experience afterwards
only confirmed the truth of his observations.</p>

<p>I now began to practise the men with their
firelocks. As this was almost the only drilling
they got, there remained plenty of spare time
for drinking-bouts in public-houses, and for
them to spend their bounty-money and report
on the glorious advantages of being <em>soldiers in
prospective</em>.</p>

<p>I had, amongst the men, enlisted a noted
character at Cape Town called “Happy Jack.”
Evans was his real name, a common sailor now,
but who had been boatswain in the navy.</p>

<p>He was rarely in barracks, but always to be
hailed, as he good-naturedly explained to the
guard on duty, in such or such a public-house.
It may be readily supposed that men enlisted
under the auspices of Happy Jack were not
the best of characters; in fact, many of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
were what they termed at the Cape, <em>laggers</em>&mdash;that
is to say, men who, having got away from
Norfolk Island, or other penfolds for black sheep,
lag behind, under guardianship of Dutch laws at
the Cape, instead of trusting their precious selves
to the supervision of their own natural police at
home.</p>

<p>The local authorities, however, with the praiseworthy
object of dispersing the scabby flock
under their charge, provided the ranks of my
corps with some desperate cases, whom they
ordered to enlist as the alternative of going to
prison. I had a shrewd guess as to the meaning
of these energetic efforts to strengthen the
force under my command; but I used to shut
my eyes as closely as possible in accepting the
proffered services of some of my recruits, and
unless something too glaring forced itself on
my attention&mdash;such as a man with one arm,
a wooden leg, or stone blind&mdash;I used to accept
the services of almost all, and place them at
her Majesty’s disposal,&mdash;taking often, when
tempted, a cripple, as the necessary evil attendant
upon the services of a good man,
these being the conditions on which the contract
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
was several times concluded between
myself and the police. No doubt I was often
undecided as to whether or not I should attempt
to knock down the authors of some of
the practical jokes that were played upon me;
but when I came to reflect that my best
friends at the Cape advised me strongly to go
home and leave the Kaffirs alone, I could not
feel much surprised that stupid people, to
whom I was unknown, should be much more
practical in their method of enforcing the same
opinion upon me.</p>

<p>And truly my position seemed a riddle in
more ways than one. I was very young&mdash;scarcely
twenty-two, and looked still younger. I was
spending large sums at the Cape to regain a
footing in the British army, when I might
have easily purchased, for a tenth of the money,
a commission at home. My ways were foreign.
I had been brought up mostly abroad&mdash;in
France and Germany. My military notions
were based on their schools. My actual experience
of war had been gained in Algeria,
Hungary, and in the streets of Paris and
Vienna during the late revolutions, where I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
had taken somewhat more than a strict observer’s
part on the side of legal authority.</p>

<p>I could not understand the half-military,
half-civilian existence of a British officer, and,
excepting the Artillery and Engineers, thought
them a very unscientific lot. No one could
doubt their fighting capacity; but their capabilities
for undertaking a campaign against
European armies was very dubious in my sight.</p>

<p>An enthusiast myself in my belief in Christ,
I yet belonged to no Church in Christendom&mdash;in
short, I have often wondered since how I
escaped shipwreck amidst the shoals and breakers
that surrounded me.</p>

<p>Two bright spots alone shone through this turmoil
and anxiety. At the Cape, Colonel Neville
Chamberlain and Major Quinn (two nobler
specimens of the conquerors of India could
hardly be found) took me kindly by the hand;
and as they told me, how with quiet demeanour
and ironside determination of will, native levies
were led, and victories won in India, I humbly
resolved to follow, if I could, the noble example
they gave me. An anecdote concerning a sword
which Colonel Neville Chamberlain presented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
me with, may not be out of place in these pages.
It was a weapon that had fallen into his hands
after an engagement, and was considered a
splendid specimen of Indian workmanship.</p>

<p>In the year 1853 I was sent on a mission to
Constantinople, and took the sword with me,
and used to wear it in my frequent visits to
the Seraskierat. Riza Pasha, who then presided
there, asked me one day to allow him to
look at it, and after gravely reading the Arabic
characters embossed upon the blade, passed it
on to other members of the Council Board.
One and all seemed much surprised at the
writing, and at my being the possessor of such
a weapon. Mr Sarel, the dragoman of the
Embassy, who was with me at the time, explained
how it came from India, and into my
possession. Riza asked to be allowed to show
it to the Sultan, to which I consented, but
never could get it returned. As, however, I
repeatedly asked for it, and threatened to speak
to the Ambassador on the subject, Riza one day
sent me another sword, with a firman in a white
satin bag, containing my nomination to the
colonelcy of the second regiment of the Sultan’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Roumelian Guard. I was rather induced to look
upon the affair as a mystification; but Sarel
explained to me that it was quite serious, and in
reality a compliment paid to Lord Stratford de
Redcliffe, and that I had better accept the sword
and the commission, as I should never see Colonel
Chamberlain’s sword again. In this manner I
entered the Turkish army; and although I never
assumed the actual command as colonel, it was
(by a strange coincidence) one of those regiments
that formed the brigade of cavalry which
I afterwards commanded on the Danube. It
was a curiously-officered regiment. I, the colonel,
had been named through being the possessor
of a certain sword; the lieutenant-colonel,
Said Bey, through being the possessor of a wonderful
flute (he had been chief flute-player to
the Sultan); one of the majors, Mourad Bey, for
being a renegade Frenchman; and the other
major, an Irishman, for being the supposed son
of an English Prime Minister. The men, however,
were splendid fellows, and some became
passionately attached to me. As a proof of
this, one day when, as quartermaster-general
of the Turkish forces, I was sending to Eupatoria,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
in the Crimea, Osman Pasha’s army from
Cisebole, in the Bay of Bourgas, Halil Pasha,
brother-in-law of the Sultan, and commander
of the Turkish cavalry, refused to obey my
repeated orders concerning the embarkation of
the women of his harem (a proceeding to which
I was opposed), when, at my command, two of
my orderlies&mdash;Mourad and Mahamet-Chousch&mdash;took
him by the “scruff” of the neck, before the
whole of his staff, and pitched him off the pier
into the sea, after his screaming women.</p>

<p>Not a man stirred an inch to save him until
I gave orders to do so; and the half-drowned
Pasha contented himself with writing a long
letter of complaint to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe,
who, in reply, said he only got what he
deserved.

<p>To return to my men at the Cape;&mdash;Happy Jack
and I, after many a good look at one another,
were gradually nearing the point of trying conclusions
as to which of the two really commanded
the corps. On his part it was one perpetual
scene of half-drunken, half-intentional
defiance. He rolled about the streets in uniform,
followed by besotted comrades, to gain, as
he said, by their jolly appearance, fresh adherents.
No one, he pretended, could look at their
happy condition and refuse to join such companions.
The fact is, he did bring in many
recruits, and I hardly knew how to get on with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
or without him. Providence, however, decided
in my favour. Colonel Ingleby, commandant of
the town and castle, a fine old soldier, and extremely
kind to me, sent a small detachment
of artillerymen to keep order in the barracks.
Happy Jack’s fate was sealed. A picket of
regulars sent to scour the public-houses for
absentees, brought Jack to barracks in a woful
plight. He had had a frog’s march&mdash;that
is to say, on hands, belly, and knees&mdash;almost
from one end of the town to the other. Refusing
to obey the picket, and march to barracks
on his legs, he had been kindly allowed to come
on all-fours, held up by the collar of his coat,
for fear of stumbling, and the seat of his unmentionables.
Poor fellow! he felt sorely his
abject degradation in the eyes of his associates,
male and female, and kept ever afterwards well
in the background.</p>

<p>The day now approached for our starting to
the front. Captain Hall, who commanded the
man-of-war on the station, had prepared to take
us all on board, but the difficulty was how to
get the men there. Every one knew perfectly
well, from their many loud boastings on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
point, that they had not the least intention of
going; and as no means existed in the town by
which forcible coercion could be attempted on
so large a body of men with a reasonable chance
of success, it did look a very dubious question.</p>

<p>The matter, however, was finally arranged
after this fashion, between Captain Hall, Colonel
Ingleby, the police, and myself. We were
to have a grand field-day, to end by a display of
military prowess on the part of the men in
a sham engagement, and thereby prove their
fighting capacity against her Majesty’s sable
foes. The general plan consisted in the police,
and all the artillerymen Colonel Ingleby could
spare, landing on the beach just outside the
castle, under the protection of the guns of Captain
Hall’s ship. They were then to proceed
inland towards Wineberg, and, on arriving about
two miles from the shore, were to be suddenly
confronted by my corps, and driven back to the
ship. The first part of the plan was carried out
as intended. In the first place, Colonel Ingleby,
in full uniform, attended by a sub-lieutenant,
Dr B&mdash;&mdash;, and two commissariat officers in regimentals,
passed a review of the men, 167 rank
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and file. They looked very well in line, and
knew enough drill to take open order for inspection;
so that the first part of the programme
gave every appearance of having a happy issue,
by the way in which it was being carried out.</p>

<p>Colonel Ingleby, however, had the unfortunate
idea to make the men a speech in praise of
their gallant appearance. This was not in the
order-book, so I scarcely knew what to say in
reply. Happy Jack, however, was equal to the
occasion. He stepped boldly out of the ranks
and walked up to the Colonel, and said that as
he was so pleased with their trim, he hoped
he would, man-o’-war fashion, order a glass of
grog all round. The good-tempered Colonel,
rather taken aback, replied, “You had better ask
Captain Lakeman for that.” “No, no,” said
Jack; “I know better than to ask the skipper when
the admiral is present, so please order the grog.”
It <em>was</em> ordered. The Colonel drank to our success,
I returned thanks, the men cheered, and
then broke out with “We won’t go home till
morning.”</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour passed in this
agreeable manner, the men fell readily enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
into the ranks, and proceeded in a rollicking,
spirited manner towards the position assigned
us in the forthcoming engagement. We had
hardly taken up our post in the bend of the
road that led to the Observatory, when the continued
booming of Captain Hall’s guns told us
the enemy were disembarking. Shortly afterwards
they could be espied feeling their way
through the brushwood that led up the valley.
In approaching the cross-road that wound its
way towards Wineberg they divided their forces.
One party&mdash;the police&mdash;took the road; the other&mdash;the
regulars&mdash;continued their way through the
scrubby brushwood. They advanced but slowly,
taking all due precautions, probing the ground
right and left, with an advance and a rear
guard. The police, on the contrary, came up
the dusty road in a most disorderly, unhesitating
manner&mdash;looking like a swarm of blue-bottles
on a white, smoking, Cambridge sausage.
This was setting such a bad example to my
recruits that I determined to give them a profitable
lesson; so, calling in the outposts, I prepared
to meet them suddenly with the whole
force at my disposal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>On they heedlessly came to the bend of the
road, when they found themselves confronted
by an impassable barrier of prickly cactus, that
I had hastily strewn there. They evidently
thought this a warning of approaching danger,
for, hastily unslinging their carbines, they prepared
for action. But I left them no time for
this ceremonious proceeding. The order to fire
was given, and these brave but misguided invaders
received such a peppering discharge from
both sides of the road that the error of their
ways became pungently manifest; and, without
the slightest demur, they wriggled their bent
forms into the smallest possible shape, and
bolted in the opposite direction. But my men
were most anxious to prove their capacity for
far harder fighting than the evanescent police
force allowed them to display; so, with loud
shouts and exulting halloos, they jumped up
from behind the fence which had hitherto concealed
them, and started off in pursuit of the
scuttling foe.</p>

<p>Many a long itching grudge was feelingly
rubbed off that day upon the heads of the
police. Happy Jack was particularly conspicuous,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
as, with tucked-up sleeves, he laid the butt
of his rifle (much to my dread of its breaking)
upon the heads and shoulders of his natural
enemies, in a manner quite uncalled for by the
stricken.</p>

<p>But there is a turn in the tide of events
which, taken at the flood, makes one at times
feel somewhat giddy as it whirls us round.
This dizzying ebb of fortune ran counter to
Happy Jack, and threw him on his beam-ends
in the most reckless fashion.</p>

<p>It happened that Sergeant Herridge of the
police force, and in command of that party,
seeing the discomfiture of his men, had had the
discretion to lead them back to Cape Town,
and was showing the way as fast as his portly
person, under the sweltering heat of the sun
and the battle combined, allowed him to do.
Happy Jack espied the retreating chief, and
took up the pursuit like Achilles after affrighted
Hector, chevying him round and round his
admiring followers. At length he reached the
spent chieftain, and placing the muzzle of his
firelock between the outspread coat-tails of the
flying victim, blew a cartridge off at that part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
upon which people usually sit. The effect
was startling. Hector cut a double-shuffle
high up in the air like an exploding cracker,
and while still wreathed in smoke, swung round
his truncheon with Parthian address on the
grinning face of Jack, whose head came to the
ground&mdash;cracker number two.</p>

<p>Now was the time for the victorious sergeant
to make off: the road was clear, and he had my
good wishes that it should be kept so. But the
foolish fellow, instead of running away, to live
and fight another day, sat deliberately down in
the dusty road and began bumping his hindquarters
violently on the ground, to stamp out
the fire the cartridge of Happy Jack had lit in
his rear. This ludicrous display of stern-firing
gave time for other men to come up; he was
made prisoner, and Jack, recovering his senses,
feelingly kicked the fire out of the singeing
sergeant in double-quick time. Herridge was
removed on board in a critical state, refusing
in his disgraced condition to be taken to Cape
Town; ultimately, upon recovery, he enlisted
in my corps.</p>

<p>On the discomfiture of the police, the artillerymen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
in the valley began to retreat; but in this
direction the pursuit was very slack. My men
bent all their energies in scattering every vestige
of civil authority; they evidently began to
consider themselves as one with the soldiers&mdash;in
fact, it was in recounting the mishaps that
had that day befallen the police that we retired
laughingly together, with those whom we were
supposed to be repulsing with great vigour.</p>

<p>Finally, on arriving at the beach from whence
the enemy had started, a still greater surprise
awaited us; but this time (as if by just reprisal)
it fell exclusively upon my own men, and that
in a most bewildering manner.</p>

<p>Captain Hall had landed his marines and
a detachment of blue-jackets, who, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</em>,
disarmed my men, as they arrived in
batches of twos and threes, and placed them in
files along the sea-shore. The climax had arrived;
and to the astonishment, no doubt, of
many beholders from the town, who had come
to witness what they supposed was likely to
be an exciting performance, I was quite equal
to the task of stage-manager on this occasion.
In a few words I explained to my future heroes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
that the time was come to go to the front and
show to the Kaffirs what we were capable of
doing. The black was pressing hard on the
white man, who looked to us for help; the ship
was ready to convey us; the cheers of the inhabitants
of Cape Town were a token of what
was expected; in fact, the time had arrived
when the very humblest had a duty to perform.</p>

<p>Go we must; so I called for three cheers,
and “Forward to the boats!” Some murmured
that they had not wished friends “good-bye;”
others talked of kits left behind; but they
were too tired to resist physically, and without
consultation they were unequal to combined
action; so, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</em>, we managed, one after
another, to get them all aboard ship, excepting
some twenty or so, who had come to grief in
our late engagement with the police, and these I
left behind. By the exertions of Captain Hall,
who appeared to me a most painstaking, energetic
officer, we soon got safely stowed away
on board, and three days after landed at Port
Elizabeth. Mr Durant Deare, a merchant of
that town, kindly offered me quarters under
his hospitable roof. The men were billeted in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the town; and two days afterwards, with seven
waggon-loads of ammunition and five gun-carriages,
we started for Graham’s Town.</p>

<p>Foreseeing the disorderly manner in which my
rough lot would probably leave the grog-shops,
I started very early in the morning, before the
inhabitants had got up&mdash;for I was loath to show
our, as yet, disorganised state. I waited until
fairly on the march before bringing a tighter
hand to bear upon the many ruffians in my
corps, who, half in joke, half inquiringly, looked
me in the face, and called me mate, skipper, or
captain, as they interpreted its meaning.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day we arrived
at the Ada bush; this was some twenty miles
in breadth, composed of jungle-wood, free from
Kaffirs, but infested with bands of marauders,
consisting of native levies who had fled, weapons
in hand, from the seat of war. As we were
encamped that night, I strolled the greater part
of it around the fires, and gathered from several
parties that the next day something eventful
was to take place in which <em>my</em> fate was concerned.
I felt perfectly tranquil, however,
trusting that I should be equal to the task of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
holding my own against such an abandoned,
disunited lot&mdash;for I had also many good, God-fearing
men among them.</p>

<p>The next morning, on the order being given
for the men to fall in for roll-call, no one
stirred. Sergeant Waine, who had been a non-commissioned
officer in the 44th, but broken
and discharged for bad conduct, to whom I had
given the stripes in consideration of his regimental
knowledge, stepped up to me, and said
that the men wanted grog served out to them
before they would budge, and if they did not
get it, would return to Port Elizabeth. I did not
reply to him, but, getting on my horse, rode up
to the men and asked if they had enlisted with
the intention of obeying orders or not. No one
replied; and giving the word to fall in, they
sullenly did so.</p>

<p>The Hottentot drivers inspanned the bullocks,
and I repeated “Forward!” in a tone that seemed
strange even to myself, so authoritative and full
of energy did it sound in my own ear. All
obeyed, and we started on the march; scarcely,
however, had we entered the bush before a shot
was fired. I saw from the smoke where the discharge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
came from, so, riding to the spot, inquired
who had fired. Sergeant Waine came to the
front and said he had. I reminded him of the
order which had been given that no firing was
to take place under any consideration, unless I
or Lieutenant Pilkington gave the command.
He muttered something unintelligible in reply;
and I repeated the order aloud, to be heard by
all around, that if any man discharged a firelock
without orders I would have him punished
as severely as the circumstances allowed. I
then rode on again towards the head of the
column, when another shot was fired, and this
time the bullet came whistling very close to my
head. On looking round I saw that the shot
was fired from the same spot again, around
which the men were now gathered in a cluster.
I felt that the crisis had come, so loosening my
pistol in the holster-pipe (an Adams’ revolver,
one of the first made), I rode back and asked
who fired. Waine replied he did. “Who gave
the order?” said I. “A magpie,” he answered.
I called out for Sergeant-major Herridge, the
late police officer, who had quite recovered, and
had become a most efficient subordinate. “Take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Waine’s firelock from him,” I said. This was
quickly done. “Now tie him up to that gun-carriage
and give him three dozen.” Waine
bawled out to the men, and asked whether they
would see him flogged like a nigger. Before
they could reply I drove my horse amidst them,
revolver in hand, and cried out that the first
man who opened his mouth, or moved, I would
blow his brains out, at the same time pointing
the muzzle to some of their heads, as I saw they
were more or less inclined to disobey my injunctions.
Sergeant Herridge was a powerful
man, and Waine was soon tied up; but there
being no “cat” to flog him with, I ordered it
to be done with his belt. And well was it laid
on. The fellow bellowed lustily, and I asked
the men what they thought of such a blubbering
cur. Happy Jack now began to cry “Shame.”
I rode him down, and as he scrambled from
between my horse’s legs in an awful state of
funk, some of the men laughed outright, and he
got no more openly-shown sympathy than his
comrade Waine. After the flogging was over
I told Herridge to give back to Waine his
leather jacket. The ruffian said, “You will give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
me my jacket, but why don’t you give me my
firelock?” “Give him that also,” said I. On
getting it he began loading, and looking at me in
a most significant manner. When he came to put
the cap on the nipple, either from the numbing
pain of the flogging, or from the violence with
which Herridge had pulled off his pouch, he
could not find a cap. I offered him one&mdash;it
was only a pistol cap (but I did not think of that
at the time); when he looked at me, threw down
his firelock, and said, “No, I won’t shoot you.”
Seeing this sign in my favour, I began to explain
to the men that no one had a greater
horror, of flogging than I had, and that I never
would have had it done had it not been to
punish a cowardly villain who had attempted
to shoot me from behind. If any of them had
a complaint to make, let them come to me, face
to face, and explain, and they never would find
me unwilling to listen, or to redress any just
grievance. Waine was then placed on a gun-carriage
alongside of Happy Jack, and we once
more started on our march. From that day
my orders were obeyed, and matters assumed
a more orderly aspect.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>On fording Sunday River, which runs through
the Ada bush, the whole column nearly came to
grief. All due precautions had, however, been
taken as though passing through an enemy’s
country, lining both sides of the ford&mdash;an advanced-guard
and a rear-guard. But notwithstanding
orders, some of the men had strolled
down the banks of the river in order to find a
favourable spot to bathe. While thus proceeding,
some marauding Fingoes were espied; a
cry arose that the Kaffirs were coming, a stampede
ensued, and my men bolted like rabbits
into the bush. The Hottentot drivers cut the
traces of their oxen, disappearing with their
cattle, and I was left alone with the waggons
in the middle of the river, with five or six men
whom I had managed to keep together&mdash;my
anxiety barely sufficing to retain my laughter at
the ridiculous disappearance of the whole party.</p>

<p>The Fingoes, however, were as much frightened
as my men had been, and ran away in
the opposite direction; so when my fellows
had been sufficiently scratched and blown by
making their way through the prickly underwood,
unmolested by all except their own fears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
(and the thorns), they soon retraced their footsteps,
and could be seen in twos and threes peeping
from the outskirts of the jungle to know
whether the coast had become clear. On getting
them together again, I made a speech,
and so enlarged upon their ridiculously discreditable
behaviour, that they swore, one and
all, that they would never so commit themselves
again. To put their courage to the test,
I determined to encamp that night where this
occurred&mdash;in the middle of the bush. This was
rather hazardous; but I counted upon the
danger of Fingo marauders to keep them together,
and in my own bold attitude to keep
the latter off.</p>

<p>My position was a strange one; and as I lay
that night upon a gun-carriage, having for companions
Waine moaning over the pains in his
back, and Happy Jack muttering threats of
courts-martial, I thought, if Providence did
not intervene, the thread of my existence would
possibly snap somehow.</p>

<p>The night passed off calmly enough, and the
next morning saw us safely on the other side
of the bush; and that evening we encamped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
at a farm belonging to Mr Bruckyer, a Dutch
settler from Haarlem&mdash;which town, by the way,
was the home of my forefathers in King William
III.’s reign; therefore, being somewhat akin
through ancestral associations, we soon became
good friends. This gentleman not only furnished
my corps with an abundance of farm
produce&mdash;accepting only our thanks in return&mdash;but
also took charge of seven men who were
incapable, from illness and sore feet, of continuing
with the column. These men were
afterwards sent on in a waggon to Fort Beaufort,
some hundred and twenty miles off, to
rejoin the corps. Mr Bruckyer again refused
all remuneration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE DUTCH AND ENGLISH SETTLERS&mdash;FIRST TRIAL OF THE MINIE
AT THE CAPE&mdash;I PART WITH HAPPY JACK&mdash;MARCH INTO GRAHAM’S
TOWN&mdash;THE OFFICERS OF THE CORPS&mdash;COLONEL CLO&Euml;TE&mdash;SHORTCOMINGS
OF THE SERVICE&mdash;THE COMMISSARIAT ORDERED TO FORT
BEAUFORT&mdash;ARRIVE AT HEADQUARTERS.</p>

<p>As a rule, I found the settlers&mdash;English and
Dutch&mdash;a fine, generous-hearted set of people;
and many of them who read these lines may,
I hope, think with pleasure of the happy times
we passed together.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to get rid of my sick
men, as I had no medical man with the corps;
and the only medicines or pharmaceutical
knowledge I possessed were gleaned from a
small medicine-chest I had purchased at Port
Elizabeth. It was one of the ceaseless threats
of Happy Jack that I had had a man flogged
without a medical man being present, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
without having remedies at hand in case of
accident.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded to Mr Judd’s
farm, some ten miles farther on the road. Here
I had an opportunity of showing what the Minie
rifle could perform. We were sitting under the
veranda of Mr Judd’s house examining one of
the men’s rifles, and I was explaining the advantage
of a rapid twist with an elongated
bullet having an expansive base, &amp;c. Mr
Judd asked if it would reach some bullocks
which were grazing five or six hundred yards
off, adding that I might try if I liked, for the
cattle were his. To this I consented; and laying
the rifle on the balcony as a rest, I singled
out a bullock to his attention&mdash;fired. I had
the satisfaction that, either from the whistling
of the ball or from being actually struck, the
mark had been attained, for the animal immediately
started off at a trot. All doubts,
however, soon came to an end; for the poor
brute lay down, and before we could reach the
spot, had died,&mdash;the ball had passed through
its body. This, no doubt, was a great fluke;
but it had the good result of proving the value
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the weapon to the men (a great many were
looking on while I fired), and also leading them
to suppose I was a first-rate shot.</p>

<p>At this farm I also had the satisfaction of
getting rid of Happy Jack. I afforded him
the opportunity of deserting during the night,
which he availed himself of; and I took particular
care not to have him awakened the
next morning as we departed, although I knew
he was lying drunk in a cattle-kraal a short
way off. Waine became much more humble
after Jack’s desertion, and before we reached
Graham’s Town had been restored to the ranks.
So all fear of my being called up before a court-martial
for flogging a man with an illegal instrument&mdash;which
his belt undoubtedly was&mdash;soon
disappeared.</p>

<p>We made a great sensation on our entrance
into Graham’s Town: the gun-carriages, wrapped
up in hay to prevent any ill effects from the
heat of the sun, might be readily taken for
real artillery. The men&mdash;mostly seafaring
people, with big rounded shoulders, bronzed
faces, and long hirsute appendages&mdash;might, for
size and determination of look, compare advantageously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
with any troops in the colony. They
also wore leather helmets somewhat similar to
those now adopted in the service, which added
considerably to their martial appearance; and
altogether they presented to the beholder (who
knew nothing of their bolting proclivities, as
lately displayed in the Ada bush) a most formidable
accession to her Majesty’s forces at
the Cape.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to give a slight
outline of the officers who commanded my detachment.</p>

<p>My first lieutenant, &mdash;&mdash;, a near relative of
Lord &mdash;&mdash;’s, was a tall, handsome fellow, who
had been in her Majesty’s service, of rather
loose habits; not wanting in pluck, but fonder
of excitement over the card-table than in the
field.</p>

<p>My second lieutenant was named H&mdash;&mdash;d, an
enthusiast on the mission of Christianity. He
had been lately suffering from brain fever, and
with his hair cropped short, tall, gaunt figure,
and deep-set, glistening eyes, looked the modern
representative of one of Cromwell’s Ironsides.
In spirit, he was a man all over; and had he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
possessed more <em>physique</em> to ballast his mental
faculties, would have left no inconsiderable
mark in this world. As I pen these lines,
I feel he was <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un grand homme manqu&eacute;</em>, and
regret that a word I spoke during the heat of
an engagement, and which he misinterpreted,
caused him to resign.</p>

<p>My third lieutenant, named P&mdash;&mdash;n, was a
gentleman by birth, and had been in her Majesty’s
service, but had advisedly resigned after
having thrown a glass of wine in his superior
officer’s face. He was of a tall, lusty figure,
full of animal courage, and fond of animal enjoyment.</p>

<p>Sergeant-major Herridge I have already described.</p>

<p>Sergeant Beaufort had been in the Rifle Brigade:
he was the handsomest man I perhaps
ever beheld; with short, crisp, light chestnut
locks, full, oval countenance, tall stature&mdash;six
feet two inches&mdash;and well-rounded limbs. He
looked the picture of what Richard Cœur de
Lion might have been.</p>

<p>Sergeant Shelley had been in the 60th Rifles:
a tall, lank fellow, with arms and legs on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
move, like a windmill in a gale of wind&mdash;always
threatening to fly off at a tangent, but nevertheless
fixed to his post. He became very attached
to me; and many a time, while thinking myself
alone in the bush, Sergeant Shelley would appear
at my side, with “All right, captain; here
I am;” and all right it was, for the man was a
host in himself, through his acuteness, strength,
and daring.</p>

<p>Another character was Sergeant Dix. He had
been a well-to-do confectioner in Cape Town,
who had left pastry and the sweets of marriage
life to join my corps, owing, it was surmised, to
the depredations of an officer on the presiding
goddess of his wedding-cake. Poor Dix! he
used to make the men suffer to ease his own
pains. Up and down the lines he used to <em>fizz</em>
with his fat podgy legs, basting the men with
the hot drippings of his marital wrath, until at
last I was obliged to reduce him to the ranks,
and install him as <em>chef</em> in my own cuisine.
Such is a faint outline of the corps which I
marched through the town, and encamped some
three miles on the other side, owing to my
well-founded dread of the grog-shops.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>It was here that I first became acquainted
with the shortcomings of the service.</p>

<p>Colonel Clo&euml;te, the Quartermaster-general,
had no more idea as to the ammunition I had
brought from Port Elizabeth than what he had
to do with it. He knew, certainly, what requisitions
he had received, but he knew no more than
I did what reserves, not actually wanted, existed
in those places. The waggons that brought
the ammunition, and had given me such anxiety
on the road, were left, during my ten days’ stay
in Graham’s Town, in the open streets; not
a sentry or guard of any sort&mdash;the Hottentot
drivers, with pipes in their mouths, seeming
the presiding guardians over British military
stores.</p>

<p>The commissariat was in the hands of the
tradesmen of the town: a Mr J&mdash;&mdash;s (banker
and merchant) seemed to have the whole charge
of the provisioning of the army. He was exceedingly
kind and courteous, a perfect gentleman
in all his doings, but yet not the right
person in the right place, I thought. Of the
military stragglers in the town, they were the
usual rag-tag and bobtail lot always to be found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
compassing the rear of an army actively engaged
in the field.</p>

<p>After waiting twelve days, I at last received
orders to proceed to Fort Beaufort. The men
being in fair condition by this time, I determined
to cover the distance (about forty miles)
in two days. This was easily accomplished;
and rather to the surprise of the Commander-in-chief,
I presented myself at headquarters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p class="hang">MY REPORT TO GENERAL COMMANDING ON STATE OF THE ROAD&mdash;OFFEND

MINIE RIFLE AGAIN&mdash;KAFFIR DEVOTION&mdash;THEIR NATURE, AND
HOW TO FIGHT THEM&mdash;AM THANKED IN GENERAL ORDERS.</p>

<p>I gave a report in writing of my doings on the
road, and my estimation of the resources and
failings as a military road, that it professed.
Amongst other things, I stated the fact of seeing
a strong detachment of the 12th Regiment uselessly
guarding a fort of no possible influence in
the actual state of the war. This brought the
staff down upon me; but I was thanked by the
General, who, as a token of welcome, presented
me with a fine chestnut charger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>The next day I was perfectly astounded at
the close proximity of the Kaffirs. There they
were in shoals, perfectly unmolested, on the
slopes of the Water-kloof, and within twelve
miles of thousands of British troops. I had
seen on many occasions the daring indifference
of the Kabyles of the Atlas Mountains, but that
was displayed on chance occasions; but here
a badly-armed, undisciplined throng of naked
savages braved with impunity, day after day,
week after week, the energies of the British
empire. I was utterly staggered for a moment
by such a display, but was not long in volunteering
to make a closer acquaintance with these
sable heroes and their strongholds. I, however,
received a good snubbing for my pains. At last
a grand expedition was planned, under General
Napier, to attack this said Water-kloof, and my
corps was assigned the post of advanced-guard.
The first day we reached Blinkwater Post, where
I made the acquaintance of the commander,
W&mdash;&mdash;d; he appeared to me one of the right
sort, although rather uselessly employed. This
is one of the great faults of our service, to place
a brilliant, dashing officer to guard an exposed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
permanent position, when a good, stolid, ordinary
being would have done quite as well, if not
better. The art of war is like the game of
chess, and I would not give much for the guiding
hand that does not know the value and place
of each figure on the board.</p>

<p>The next day, after a somewhat tiring ascent,
we crowned the heights of the Water-kloof,
without firing a shot or seeing many Kaffirs.
I was then ordered to attack the Horse-shoe&mdash;a
half-circular line of bush that fringed the precipitous
heights. This was a difficult task, from
the formation of the ground and the disheartening
reminiscences, it was murmured, which were
attached to the spot. Here it was that Colonel
Fordyce had been lately killed, and the 74th
fearfully handled. The Honourable R. C&mdash;&mdash;, the
staff officer who ordered the movement, pointed
in a somewhat vague manner to the centre of
the half-moon as the place on which I was to
begin the attack. This undefined indication left
me a considerable margin; so I managed, in the
mile of ground I had to cover before coming
within range of the Kaffir guns, to oblique so
much to the right, that I came very near that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
end of the Horse-shoe. As I got within range,
my men being in very loose order (this being
their first engagement, there was naturally some
hesitation and wavering along the line), a shot
fired by some good marksman on the enemy’s
side, brought my orderly, David M‘Intyre, to
the ground with a ball through the chest.</p>

<p>The whole line stopped as if struck by an
electric shock. Another shot as effective as the
last would, I felt sure, send them to the right-about;
so I ran to the front and shouted out,
“We shall all be shot if we remain here in the
open! To the bush, my lads! to the bush!”</p>

<p>The sense of this order was obvious. We
shouted “Hurrah!” as much to drown our own
fears as to frighten the enemy; and amidst a
rattling fire, more noisy than dangerous, we, for
safety’s sake, gallantly charged the foe. The
Kaffirs and Hottentots were evidently taken by
surprise at this display of gallantry&mdash;latterly all
the charges had been on their side. The tables
were turned, and instead of red-jackets, it was
for black-skins to fall back.</p>

<p>Once in the bush, what with cheering and
firing, we kept up such a hullabaloo, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
niggers must have thought all the white devils
of Christendom were let loose upon them. I,
who knew where the row came from, was astonished
at the effect upon my own nerves, as the
adjoining rocks reverberated the sound of our
advance. We literally chased the foe like rabbits
through the bush, and came out at the other
end of the Horse-shoe, rather disappointed than
otherwise in not meeting with more resistance.
We then fell back on the main body, having
performed our task with a decided dash and
very slight loss&mdash;two killed and five wounded.
As we were quite unmolested by the foe, it was
admirable to see the cool, collected manner in
which my men retired&mdash;in fact, I was not at
all astonished when General Napier sent a staff
officer to thank us for our gallant and orderly
bearing. We now proceeded to breakfast, and
had hardly begun, when the same officer came
back and told me to advance with my men and
endeavour to dislodge the Kaffirs from some
rough boulders of rock on the edge of the kloof,
some two miles on our left. Now this order was
unadvisable for many reasons: from the lie of
the ground it had no strategical importance;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
it neither threatened the enemy’s stronghold,
nor in any way interfered with movements we
might make to carry it.</p>

<p>My men had had a long march, which, combined
with the efforts in clearing out the Horse-shoe,
had left us without any physical energy;
whilst there were whole battalions who had not
fired a shot, and were eager for an opportunity
to distinguish themselves.</p>

<p>I, however, kept these reasonings to myself;
and giving the men orders to prepare for action,
they sprang to their feet with far more alacrity
than I had a right to expect.</p>

<p>In going to take up the ground assigned to
us as the point of attack, we passed in front of
the main body, and the General came up and
shook hands with me. This cheering token sent
us on in good spirits to within about a thousand
yards of the rocks above named. I here sent a
small detachment down a slope of ground that
led somewhat to our left, to threaten, if possible,
the flank and rear of the position in our front.</p>

<p>With the rest of the men I obliqued slightly
to the right, with the same object of turning the
rear in that direction also.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>We had advanced about half-way when the
guns of Captain Rowley’s battery opened fire
over our heads. This caused considerable uneasiness;
the men were not accustomed to the
hurling noise rushing over their heads from the
rear: some ducked, some stopped, others went
on; and the line, which hitherto had been so
well kept, assumed a most zigzag, mob-looking
appearance.</p>

<p>I have often observed that even veterans
waver and become confused under this meteor-discharge
overhead. The Kaffirs, however, did
not seem to be much frightened by the shot or
the shell. They fielded for the cannon-shot as
they rebounded from the rocks as though they
were cricket-balls. These same balls were much
prized as pestles for grinding purposes.</p>

<p>As for the shells, they no sooner burst than,
in derision, the Kaffirs picked pieces up and pretended
to throw them back at us. But now a
rocket that was intended to astonish the Kaffirs
came so close over us, that the whole line
started and ducked their heads in the most
ridiculous fashion. This profound salaam, as
we faced the foe, elicited from them a tremendous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
shout of approval in return. I profited by
this humility of ours, and as my fellows had
their faces so close to the ground, I ordered them
to lie down altogether. “Raise the sighting on
the rifles for six hundred yards. Take steady
aim. Fire!”</p>

<p>At the first discharge the Kaffirs scuttled from
the rocks in flying order, leaving, however,
several of their bodies on the ground. So the
Minie rifle did in one minute what six guns and
rocket-tubes had been attempting for the last
quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>In the course of five minutes’ firing not a
Kaffir was to be seen; even the wounded who
lay on the ground were left quite uncared for;
and what was far dearer still to a Kaffir’s heart,
blankets and <em lang="af" xml:lang="af">karosses</em> were also left behind.</p>

<p>I then cautiously advanced to within a short
distance of the rocks. The men lay down once
more, to wait for the flanking party to begin on
our left; but they had gone too far down, and
when at length they began firing, it had no influence
on the Kaffirs behind the rocks facing us.
It was difficult now to know what to do. The
enemy was far too strong for us to carry the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
position by a front attack, and my flanking party
seemed, by the sound of the firing, to be rather
going from than approaching us. At this critical
moment the recall sounded far away in the rear,
and never sound struck my ear more cheerfully
before. We fell back in the most orderly
manner; and the Kaffirs, coming out in great
numbers from behind the rocks to survey our
retreat, received a last volley in return, which
quickly sent them to the right-about.</p>

<p>The Minie rifle taught them this day a lesson
which they ever after identified with my men,
and they never forgot its instructive teaching.
We were now sent to take up our quarters near
the spot where the attack had commenced in
the morning. We were to remain there until
further orders. A body of the regular forces
was also sent to take up a position about a
mile in the rear; while the main body marched
back again to headquarters at Fort Beaufort.</p>

<p>I immediately set to work, throwing up a
defence against a night attack; and before
evening set in&mdash;there being an abundance of
stone material at hand&mdash;I had thrown up a
tolerably strong defence. The next day was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the first at which I assisted at public prayers
in the colony. My men and I were perched
on the huge boulders of rock that fringe the
Water-kloof height, and from the depths below
arose, in childlike strains, the glorious morning
hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Awake, my soul, and with the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy daily course of duty run.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>These sable children were awakening their souls
to their daily duty of cutting white men’s throats.
Something like awe crept over me at this Heaven-beseeching.
It was one of those mysterious
results of missionary instruction of which I
do not profess to know the A B C; it was
giving to this would-be slayer the name of
fratricide. I got up in a hurry and left the
spot. This awakening of Cain made me feel
very much as Abel must have felt had he
been able to run away. But these poor Hottentots,
with a strong predilection for settling
disputes with their white brother, after the
antediluvian fashion of knocking you upon
the head with a <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knobkerrie</em>, were still much
to be pitied, taken as they were from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
boundless homes and pent up in that wooded
vale below, singing of their freedom in Christ,
like caged mocking-birds imitating the hollow
sound of words that convey soul-stirring
thoughts to man. I felt more sympathy for
them than for those who had brought them
to that state.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days I had raised
a barricade round my camp strong enough
to resist any number of Kaffirs; and having
thus secured a good base of operation,
began to look about me as to how I could
best make use of it for offensive movements.
Colonel N&mdash;&mdash;, the officer who commanded the
regulars left on the heights, did not at this
time interfere in any manner with my proceedings,
so I was left perfectly free, and
decided that, with the small body of men at
my disposal, night attacks were the only
reasonable operations to be undertaken with
any hope of permanent success. The Kaffir,
lithe, supple, and vicious as a snake during
the heat of the day, loses much of his treacherous
energy at night. Ignorant and superstitious,
he would be already half conquered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
by further increasing his dread of darkness;
while the white man during the refreshing
coolness of night was at his best at the Cape;
and bugle-sounds allowed him to be governed
almost as easily as during the day. I accordingly
proceeded cautiously to accustom the men
to the work. We now received in camp a copy
of a general order thus worded:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="author">
“<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Fort Beaufort.</span></p>

<p>“General Napier speaks in the highest terms

<p class="author">
(Signed) “<span class="smcap">A. J. Clo&euml;te</span>,<br />
<em>Quartermaster-General</em>.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>This was very gratifying, and we determined
to obtain still further recognitions of services
rendered. In the course of a month we had so
far created a panic by our night attacks, that
the Kaffirs evacuated the whole of the table-land
surrounding the Water-kloof, and retired to the
valley and rocky recesses below.

<p>Another attack on a still grander scale than
the last was now decided on at headquarters;
and the Commander-in-chief, General Cathcart,
with several thousand troops, guns, &amp;c., were
accordingly assembled on the heights overlooking
the kloof. It was, however, a somewhat
tame affair. We merely marched round the
heights, and only attacked a small Kaffir village
on the edge of a promontory, called Mundell’s
Peak, that advanced like a wedge into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
middle of the above-named kloof and almost
divided it in two.</p>

<p>This operation fell to my share, and was, I
think, effectually done in fair military style.
In the general orders issued relating to the
events of the day, it stated:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>“In the attack and carrying of Mundell’s
Peak, the gallantry and spirited conduct of
Lakeman’s corps and its commander, it is
gratifying to the Commander of the Forces to
take this opportunity to notice.</p>

<p class="author">
(Signed) “<span class="smcap">A. J. Clo&euml;te</span>,<br />
<em>Quartermaster-General</em>.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>During this day I observed a tenacity of life
which seemed incredible. A soldier of the Rifle
Brigade, in looking over the edge of the kloof,
was shot through the head. I was on horseback
close to him at the time; I dismounted,
propped him up with his pack, picked up the
cap which had been knocked off by the shot,
and placed it with my handkerchief over his
face. The body was shortly afterwards put on
a stretcher and taken to Post Reteif, several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
miles off, then commanded by Captain Bruce
(King Bruce they called him), a gallant and
hospitable soldier. On the evening of the
same day I saw the man there, still breathing,
with a hole in his head through which
you might have passed a ramrod, and he only
died towards the next morning.</p>

<p>After this imposing parade of troops, the
main force marched back again to Fort Beaufort;
but the Commander-in-chief decided that
two forts were to be constructed on the heights,
about a mile to the rear of where I was stationed.
Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, R. E., was intrusted
with the building of the same; and he placed
them in such a curious fashion that they could
not be defended without firing into one another&mdash;that
is to say, the enemy, had he wished it,
might have quietly encamped between the two
and defied either to fire a shot. I pointed out
this fact to the gallant colonel; but he assured
me he had taken into consideration that the
Kaffirs had not sufficient sense to discover this
undoubted weakness in his plan.</p>

<p>The heights having thus become free, I next
proceeded to feel the way down into the Water-kloof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
itself. There was no greater difficulty
in this than in what I had already done;
in short, the Kaffirs had got such a wholesome
dread of my corps, that the trouble was to get
near them. Before a month had elapsed in this
sort of work, I had traversed the kloof from
one end to the other; and the few sable gentlemen
who still held to this home of theirs had
taken refuge on the rocks on the opposite ridge,
or what we used to call the Dead Man’s Home,
owing to the bones of some of our men remaining
unburied there. One morning, in returning
from an expedition in the Water-kloof, where
I had captured the few remaining cattle left
to the enemy, Brigadier-General N&mdash;&mdash;t, who
commanded the defenceless forts constructed
by Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, sent for me; and at his
request I gave all the information I possessed
concerning the Water-kloof, stating,
among other matters, what I had done on
the previous night. He said he was afraid
I was doing more harm than good by this
night work; it was an irregular and unmilitary
mode of proceeding; that he had thought
the matter over, and intended to clear the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
place out that day in a really effectual
manner.</p>

<p>I warned him that the enemy was driven to
desperation, and capable of mad freaks of revenge
that would certainly entail serious loss
if attacked during the day; and as a proof
of their present state, they had that morning
followed me almost into camp, and once or
twice I felt convinced by their bearing they
were half inclined to attack it. Now, if left
to themselves for a few days longer, half
starved and discouraged, they would probably
leave of their own accord that part of the
country. The General, however, pooh-poohed
my reasoning, and shortly afterwards marched
out with all his forces, composed of the 60th
Rifles, the 74th, the 91st, a battery of artillery,
rocket-tubes, &amp;c.&mdash;in fact, a most formidable
body of men, and equal, if properly handled,
to beat easily the same number of the best
troops in Europe. They proceeded towards
Mundell’s Peak, and I went to lie down as
was my wont after passing a night out.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was awakened by the
sound of big guns and heavy musketry close
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
at hand. On looking out, I saw, about a mile
off, in the open, General N&mdash;&mdash;t engaged with
the enemy. I could easily make out that he
was somewhat severely pressed, so calling for
men to follow me, I made as quickly as I could
to the front. I met on the way Captain S&mdash;&mdash;n
of the Rifles, with a party of men, axes in
hand, falling back to the rear. Captain S&mdash;&mdash;n
cried out that I had better look to myself. He
himself had been told off to cut a road into
the kloof, but they had been driven back, and
N&mdash;&mdash;t was beaten. I, however, still went
on; and gathering as I went some of the
men who were retreating, came up to the
line of fire, and faced the pursuing Kaffirs.
When I had a sufficient number in hand to
give an impetus to the movement, with a
rattling cheer we went at the Kaffirs, who at
once fell back, and eventually we pursued
them almost to Mundell’s Peak. Here our
real difficulties began. I had to return to
the camp, but there were no supports to fall
back upon; for none of the regulars, except
those with me, had followed my onward movement.
To increase the difficulties, there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
several wounded to carry and no stretchers
to lay them on. In this dilemma I sent
Lieutenant H&mdash;&mdash;d to ask General N&mdash;&mdash;t
for the required support. He did not return.
I then sent Sergeant Herridge, who, after
great delay, owing to the difficulty in finding
the General, whom he at length discovered
breakfasting, returned with the message that
he had no time nor men to spare, and I must
return the best way I could. Thank God, we
did get back, but had a narrow squeak for it.
On the first movement I made to retire, the
Kaffirs hurried to our left flank, near the edge
of the kloof, to cut us off. I followed in the
same direction, and that so closely that I drove
the greater part of them over it; and so that
effort of theirs became fruitless. While doing
this others had run forward on my right flank,
which was out in the open; but here also the
Minie rifle did its task right well, and beat
them back. Thus alternately struggling on
both flanks, I got at last to some rocks about
a mile from the camp. Here I halted until Lieutenant
H&mdash;&mdash;d, whom I now saw approaching
with the men (who had, on my sudden departure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
been left behind), came and relieved me of all
further fears. It was now, on questioning Lieutenant
H&mdash;&mdash;d as to his delay&mdash;questions which
were not very audible, owing to the firing still
going on&mdash;that he interpreted some words amiss,
and the next day, much to my regret, resigned.
After some still further delay, owing to the
desperate attempts the Kaffirs made to turn
our position, we eventually returned safely to
camp, bringing all our wounded with us.
After this affair I did not conceal my opinion of
General N&mdash;&mdash;t’s conduct towards me that day;
and D&mdash;&mdash;e, a fine young fellow of the 74th
(the “British bull-dog” they called him), thought
it incumbent upon himself to ask for an explanation
on the part of the regulars. This,
R&mdash;&mdash;y of the Artillery&mdash;a thorough officer
and gentleman, be it said&mdash;kindly gave him
for me. He appeared satisfied, and thus the
matter ended. In the report I made of this
affair, I stated matters as they virtually occurred;
and a few days after, an order arrived
in camp from headquarters, stating that no
officer of any rank whatever was to interfere
with my movements, but, on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to give me whatever help I asked for; and
Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;t, secretary to the Commander-in-chief,
sent me the following, enclosed with
a kind letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>A native levy of Fingoes was now adjoined
to my command. This strengthened my position
considerably; but what gave me an absolute
power over the native population of the
district was an event which occurred concerning
some Kaffir prisoners in my camp. It happened
thus: While out coursing one day, a short distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
from my quarters, I saw a considerable
stir there going on, and ultimately a string of
men went from thence to a by-path on the ridge
of the hill, which led down towards Blinkwater
Post. It was evidently an escort of prisoners,
and I was greatly exercised by the thought of
where these came from, knowing that there
were none excepting those in my camp, with
whom no one had the right to interfere. I
sent a man on horseback to inquire into the
matter. He came back and reported that they
were the very prisoners in question, and that
they were being removed by General N&mdash;&mdash;t’s
orders to Fort Beaufort. I galloped immediately
back, and told the officer in command of the
escort that he could not proceed: these prisoners
were mine, and had been taken in an engagement
in which none but my own men had been
employed. They were also necessary to me for
the information they could give as to the whereabouts
of the rest of the tribe. After a long
and painful interview of more than an hour, the
prisoners were taken back to my camp, escorted
by my own men. The Fingoes in my new levy,
after this act of mine, used to call me “Government,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
from, I was told, the fact of their
always hearing this word spoken of in relation
to her Majesty’s proclamations in the colony,
which always began with, “Whereas her Majesty’s
Government.” But let the fact be as it
may, from that day they were implicit followers
of mine.</p>

<p>Johnny Fingo, their chief, was a tall, powerful
fellow, who spoke Kaffir perfectly well; and
passing himself off as such, used to make excursions
among the tribes in revolt, and bring me
back most useful information. One day, however,
as if to punish me for my hardly just and
certainly arrogant act in taking back the prisoners
as above related, he led me into a painfully
false position. He reported having found
out, some seven miles on the other side of Post
Reteif, the encampment of the Kaffirs that my
night attacks had driven out of the Water-kloof.
I proceeded with him and a small escort to the
place indicated&mdash;a deep kloof in the mountains&mdash;and
certainly saw a large number of fires therein.
On returning we fell in with a small outpost
of the enemy, consisting of five men, who were
crowded together in a rude hut, dividing among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
themselves some womanly apparel, evidently the
fruits of plunder. Johnny Fingo, in his haste
to shoot these poor devils, whom we had stealthily
crept upon (having seen their camp-fire a
long way off), forgot to put a cap on his rifle,
and as the gun only snapped fire as he pulled
the trigger, some three or four feet from the
head of one of the disputing marauders, he received
in return a lunge from an assegai through
his thigh. The rest jumped suddenly up, and
an indiscriminate <em>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</em> took place. Poor Dix
received a fearful crack on the skull from a
<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knobkerrie</em> (he was never perfectly right afterwards);
Johnny Fingo got another stab in the
legs, and, what affected him still more, his beautiful
“Westley-Richards” double-barrelled rifle,
which he had obtained Heaven knows how, was
irretrievably damaged. His younger brother, a
smart lad, had his windpipe nearly torn out by
a Kaffir’s teeth. In short, they fought tooth
and nail, like so many wild beasts. It was
only after we had been all more or less scarred,
that two of the five were taken prisoners, the
other three not giving in till killed.</p>

<p>I here had an opportunity of observing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
utter indifference to physical pain which the black
man exhibits. Johnny, although badly wounded
and unable to stand, was bemoaning his broken
rifle as it lay across his knees; and while I was
bandaging his brother’s horribly-lacerated throat,
he repeatedly asked me as to the possibility of
getting the indented barrels of his rifle rebent to
their original shape.</p>

<p>On our return to the camp I immediately set
about the preparations for what I considered
would be a rather hazardous undertaking&mdash;namely,
to drive out the Kaffirs from the kloof
in which I had lately seen them.</p>

<p>Anxious also to renew my relations with the
regulars, after my late <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal entendu</em> concerning
the disposal of prisoners, I proposed a joint
expedition, which was eagerly accepted by Colonel
H&mdash;&mdash;d of the Rifle Brigade. Four days
afterwards we proceeded to the spot in question,
and not a Kaffir was to be seen, and even their
traces had been carefully obliterated. I never
was more mortified in my life; it looked to me
as though I had been attempting something even
worse than a stupid practical joke. Colonel
H&mdash;&mdash;d was, however, excessively considerate in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the matter, and affected to be perfectly satisfied&mdash;although
but the very faintest marks of the
enemy’s passage could be discovered.</p>

<p>The country being now perfectly free for
many miles around, I made long patrols to
distant parts, coming at times in contact
with small parties of the enemy, but too disheartened
to make a stand. One night, in
returning after a rather longer absence than
usual, I found a somewhat large number of
Kaffirs assembled in the abandoned village on
Mundell’s Peak. I may here mention that, as I
always marched the men by night and reposed
them by day, many rencontres of this sort occurred&mdash;that
is to say, that after pursuing the
foe for several days, we were often confronted in
a manner as surprising to the one as to the other.
I placed the men in a straight line from one edge
of the peak to the other, ordering them to lie
down, and await daylight before opening fire.
Stretching myself on the ground, just in front of
Sergeant Shelley, I gave, at the break of day, the
order to fire; when, directly afterwards, poor
Shelley struggled to his feet, and fell back again,
groaning fearfully. He was shot through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
heels. The ball that effected this came down
the line, and evidently from one of our own
men&mdash;for on either flank there were sudden
dips of several hundred feet, which rendered it
impossible for a shot from the foe to come from
thence.</p>

<p>This cowardly shot, which had been aimed
at my own head, the men declared came from
Waine. He, however, denied it so stoutly, and
no one having seen him actually fire in our direction,
I took no overt steps in the matter as to
bringing him up for it; but I determined never
to take him out again for night service. And
on after-thoughts I recollected several unaccountable
shots that had passed by me during our
nocturnal expeditions; and although I sincerely
pitied poor Shelley, I could not help feeling
thankful that through the misfortune to him I
had got rid of Waine. Shelley eventually recovered
sufficiently to go with me to the Crimea,
where he died.</p>

<p>The end of Waine was like a judgment upon
him, as I shall now attempt to describe. Always
left in camp, it was his task to clean the firelocks
when the men returned after night expeditions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
This he had to do whether any firing
took place or not, as the heavy dews rendered
the cartridges unreliable for further use if left
in the guns. On one occasion a man gave him
his firelock to clean, telling him it merely wanted
wiping out, as it was unloaded. Waine did this,
but could not clear the nipple, and after several
attempts he took the weapon back to his owner,
telling him of the fact. A cap was then put on,
and Waine, holding out his hand, told him to
fire, and see for himself. The man pulled the
trigger, the gun exploded and blew Waine’s
hand to pieces. It appeared that, unwittingly, it
had been left loaded. Waine was removed, and
shortly afterwards died of lock-jaw.

<p class="hang">FORMIDABLE ATTACK ON WATER-KLOOF&mdash;THE “BLACKSMITH’S SHOP”&mdash;SLIGHTLY
WOUNDED OVER THE EYEBROW&mdash;DICTATE REPORT TO
COLONEL CLO&Euml;TE IN PRESENCE OF GENERAL&mdash;I AM OMITTED IN
GENERAL ORDERS&mdash;PROCEED TO GRAHAM’S TOWN TO REQUEST
REVISION OF THE ORDER&mdash;INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL CATHCART&mdash;RECEIVE
GENERAL ORDER TO MYSELF&mdash;OFFERS OF GRANTS OF
LAND FOR THE MEN WHO WISHED TO SETTLE&mdash;REMOVE TO
BLAKEWAY’S FARM.</p>

<p>News now arrived in camp that the Commander-in-chief,
with all the forces at his disposal,
consisting of several thousand British soldiers,
with native levies and batteries of artillery,
was expected in the neighbourhood of the Water-kloof,
and to clear out that Kaffir stronghold
which had caused the shedding of so much
blood, and to some extent had tarnished, if not
the fame, at least the prestige, of British arms.
On the 11th July I received orders to make
the necessary preparations, and on the following
night to proceed to the Water-kloof, where I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
should be joined by Colonel Eyre with the 73d.
The 73d were called the Cape Greyhounds.
By their training they had become the most
effective fighting regiment at the Cape, and
had never left a wounded or dead man behind
in the hands of the foe. As might be expected,
Colonel Eyre himself was a most daring, energetic
officer; and Colonel H&mdash;&mdash;d and he
showed great promise of becoming remarkable
commanders. According to the instructions I
received, I started that evening to the Water-kloof;
and knowing all the winding ins and
outs of the place, found myself before daybreak
in the centre of the kloof, having been opposed
on my way by a few Hottentot deserters.
These were readily known by the use they made
of the bugle. They took refuge on the top of a
solitary mound, which stood somewhat lower
down in the valley, towards Mundell’s Peak,
and which was called the “Blacksmith’s Shop,”
from the fact of its being the place where these
same deserters (some of whom had been armourers
in the Cape corps) used to repair the
enemy’s firelocks. I waited where I was until
ten o’clock, and seeing no appearance of Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Eyre, I determined to clear out the above-named
shop, and there await further orders.
Firstly, I was induced to do this by the Hottentots,
who, seeing my inaction, had crept
somewhat disagreeably close, and opened a
galling fire; and secondly, by the supposition
that if, by some mischance, Colonel Eyre should
not appear, I was by my inaction increasing the
boldness of the foe, and thereby adding to the
difficulties of my retreat should I be compelled
to make one. This affair took more time than
I had anticipated: the day was hot, the men
had eaten no food, the hill a steep one, and
the Totties tenacious of their last grasp on
what had been for so many months a safe
home for them in the midst of a British army.</p>

<p>In charging up the hill, a shot came so close
to my head that I confess I ducked most
humbly, but was so much ashamed of this act
of mine that I pretended very awkwardly to
have stumbled. Scrambling hastily up, I received
another shot just over the eyebrow,
which whirled my helmet off, and left me bare-pated
before the cheering Totties. But I, considering
that more danger lay in the deadly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
rays of the sun than in their uncertain aim,
took off my coat, and placed it round my head;
and in this Red Riding-hood fashion, amidst the
laughter of the men, we charged up the remainder
of the hill, and drove the Totties out
of the place.</p>

<p>Here we found some provisions, and were
sitting down to the meal, when artillery opening
down in the valley told us that her
Majesty’s army was fighting its way up to
where we were quietly breakfasting.</p>

<p>Colonel Eyre now appeared on the heights
to our left; Brigadier B&mdash;&mdash;r surveyed us at
the same time on our right; Brigadier N&mdash;&mdash;t
looked on in our rear; while General Cathcart
and his brilliant staff were espying us with
their Dollonds in front, perhaps. I should have
laughed outright had I not seen such things
before during my Algerian campaigns, and at
Astley’s.</p>

<p>Hastily finishing our repast, gathering the
prisoners together, with a few heads of cattle&mdash;not
forgetting the anvil, hammer, bellows,
tongs, &amp;c., we had found in the above-mentioned
shop&mdash;I proceeded to the headquarters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of the Commander-in-chief and reported progress.
I found him toasting a chop on a ramrod.
Poor General Cathcart! He was a valiant
soldier, but had no more intuitive knowledge
of Kaffir warfare than he displayed intuition
against the Russians at Inkerman. His was
a bold soul in a skeleton’s frame; there was no
material vitality in what he did; his efforts
were spasmodic and unnatural. I laid down
the trophies of my victory, taken from the
shop, at the General’s feet, and Colonel Clo&euml;te
gravely wrote down from my dictation the details
of our proceedings. Prisoners and cattle
were handed over to the proper authorities, and
my men and I went to our quarters amidst the
congratulations of all around&mdash;they, no doubt,
as puzzled as myself to discover what there was
worthy of thanks in our conduct that day.</p>

<p>As proudly, however, as so many Redan
heroes, we marched off with our laurels, whatever
their real value might be. But if <em>we</em>
were so modest, General Cathcart was more outspoken;
he was determined to unveil to the
gaze of the world our blushing honours: a
grand general order came out&mdash;Falstaff’s men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
in buckram went down like stupid wooden-headed
skittles compared to the ebony-headed
niggers I had bowled over that day.</p>

<p>I was perfectly astounded. The General,
however, had made one slight mistake in the
hurry of the moment; my name had been <em>left
out</em>, and in its place general officers had been
mentioned, getting warm thanks for the able
measures they had taken for carrying out the
Commander-in-chief’s plan to clear the Water-kloof.
Those who had not that day seen a shot
fired, or a prisoner taken, nor even had a distant
view of the Blacksmith’s Shop, were dragged
before the British public as worthy recipients of
well-earned thanks. This, I thought, was rather
too serious a mistake, so I determined to lay
the matter once more before the Commander-in-chief
and ask for a revision of his general order.</p>

<p>In furtherance of this, I proceeded to headquarters,
at Graham’s Town. On arrival I explained
the object of my journey to Colonel
S&mdash;&mdash;, who told me it was perfectly right that
something should be done, but he hardly knew
how to set about it, and referred me to Colonel
Clo&euml;te as the proper person to apply to. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
was, however, of Happy Jack’s opinion, not to
appeal to a subordinate when I could get a
hearing from the Commander; so, without more
ado, I presented myself <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</em> to
the General, who was sitting in the adjoining
room at the time.</p>

<p>After his inquiries as to the object of my
journey, I asked him as quietly as the emotions
then striving within me would allow, that my
efforts in the late clearing out of the Water-kloof
should be mentioned in the same kind manner
in which he had stated my previous services&mdash;and
if he thought it requisite for the public
good to publish the names of officers who had
not seen a shot fired that day, I hoped he would
consider that my name had still juster claims
for his acknowledgment. The General rose in a
towering passion, exclaiming that if I did not
resign immediately he would have me tried by
court-martial. I replied that, if he would consent
to my stating the real causes for sending
in my resignation, I was ready to pen it there
and then before him. After a pause he asked
me to be seated, and placing himself on a camp-stool,
the old soldier began conning the matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
over to himself, looking towards me at times
more inquiringly than decided as to which of
the two had the best of the case. His womanly
weakness to please the great men at home had
evidently led him to pander a little too much
to their acquaintances out here, whilst I, whom
he personally liked, had been unduly neglected.
The thought was galling; but at last he rose,
and said he had not forgotten me, but thought
it better to mention my name in a different
manner; and was then occupied in sending his
despatches home to the Horse Guards, in which
he had asked for a military appointment for me
in India. “Leave me now,” he added, “and tomorrow
you shall have a general order also.”</p>

<p>In fulfilment of this promise, Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; called
upon me the next day, with “Here,
Lakeman, is what you asked for&mdash;a general
order all to yourself&mdash;while the rest of us only
get mentioned in a lump. I am, however,
pleased at the result of your interview with the
General. I could not help hearing in the next
room that it was rather hot at one time; but
all’s well that ends well&mdash;give us your hand.”
No mention by me could have done kind-hearted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
brave Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; any good, dead or alive;
but now that he has laid down his life for his
country, he belongs somewhat to all that remain;
and I wish to say how much I respected
and liked him. Had he not been so much
above me in station and favour, I should add
still more to my panegyric.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="author">
“<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Graham’s Town</span>,<br />
<em>October</em> 7, 1852.</p>

<p>“Lakeman’s Volunteer Corps, from their good
conduct and the gallantry of their commander,
not only in the recent clearing out of the Water-kloof,
but also on many previous occasions,
will be called for the future the Water-kloof

<p class="author">
(Signed) <span class="smcap">A. J. Clo&euml;te</span>,<br />
<em>Quartermaster-General</em>.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Thus ended my only disagreement on military
matters of this kind at the Cape. I rather
cemented than otherwise my relations with the
Commander-in-chief, but became the acknowledged
enemy of Colonel Clo&euml;te, the Quartermaster-general,
who, I had good reason for
believing, had been the originator of the dispute
in question.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>The ill-will, however, was all on his side; he
had taken a great dislike, it seemed, to my
method of discussing military and political
matters in general; we were especially divided
as to the meaning of <em>colonial allegiance</em>; and
the fact of us being both of Dutch origin did
not mend matters in a colony in which the inhabitants
had such different objects in view as
the Dutch and English settlers had.</p>

<p>I returned next day to the front with an offer
I had in my possession from the Commander-in-chief
to any of the men who wished to
establish themselves on the frontier as military
settlers, of a small but comfortable homestead,
sufficient cattle and means to begin farming
with, and future help should necessity require
it, on the condition of their presenting themselves
for military service whenever called upon
by her Majesty’s Government. I kept this offer
by me, never seeing my way perfectly clear to
make use of it. The men were not of the right
sort to cement goodwill between natives and
settlers, but the matter got winded about among
them, and much increased the difficulties of my
command. On the slightest reproof they would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
flaunt before me their titles as farmers in prospective;
and this they carried on to such a
ridiculous excess, that I have known them,
when under the influence of drink, attempt to
turn men out of public-houses under the pretext
that they were not fit associates for gentlemen
farmers. I had also an order that freed me
from any authority, military or civil, in the discharge
of the duty of keeping clear of Kaffirs
the district around Fort Beaufort; also another
giving me the liberty of fixing my headquarters
anywhere within ten miles of that place. I
accordingly selected Blakeway’s Farm as the
most suitable spot for carrying out my instructions,
and immediately removed there.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief was now ready for
his grand expedition into Basutoland. This
carrying of the war into distant parts was, as
far as I could judge, a most unwise undertaking.
The colony, and more particularly its
frontier, was in a far too unsettled state to receive
an accession of territory with benefit to
itself or profit to the land annexed; while the
costly expedient of retaining several thousand
British troops at the Cape for the sake of punishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Basutos, was like keeping up a large
hawking establishment of peregrine falcons to
chase some troublesome crows. A few police
jackets stuffed with Government proclamations
would have done the work equally well.</p>

<p>This untimely craving for excitement beyond
the pale of legitimate hereditary succession has
always been the bane of young colonies&mdash;and
also, alas! of rapidly wearing out motherlands.
A violent extension of boundaries cannot easily
be justified. Violence begets violence; and
nothing will rankle so much in the minds of
men, from generation to generation, as the idea
that they have been unjustly deprived of their
forefathers’ land.

<p class="hang">KAFFIR CHARACTERISTICS&mdash;THE CRUELTIES OF WAR&mdash;NO REAL
SYMPATHY BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE&mdash;KAFFIR CRUELTIES&mdash;NIGHT
ATTACK ON A KAFFIR VILLAGE&mdash;WOUNDED PRISONER&mdash;“DOCTOR”
DIX&mdash;KAFFIRS BECOME RARE&mdash;CAPTURE OF NOZIAH,
SANDILLI’S SISTER&mdash;SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF HER ATTENDANT&mdash;SERGEANT
HERRIDGE.</p>

<p>It was during this period, while all elements of
warfare at the Cape were dying of exhaustion,
that I had time to observe many characteristics
of the Kaffir race.</p>

<p>One remarkable trait in their character is
their sterling singleness of purpose in whatever
they undertake. Whatever task a Kaffir has in
hand, he does it thoroughly&mdash;no hesitation, no
swerving from the object proposed; there is a
childlike belief in the possible attainment of
whatever they seek, which seems incredible to
those who know the folly of the searcher.</p>

<p>Two small pieces of stick joined together by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
a strip of leather, and blessed by a witch-doctor,
would enable him to face death, in any shape,
undismayed, secure in the thought that he
possesses a talisman which renders him invulnerable.</p>

<p>A Kaffir will chase a whim, a freak, or a
fancy as persistently and as eagerly as a schoolboy
will chase a butterfly until he sinks from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>I have seen a native woman seated on the
ground, mirroring herself in a bit of broken
glass, and vainly trying to reduce her crisp
woolly locks into some faint semblance of an
Englishwoman’s flowing hair. Thus she would
comb and comb, in the useless effort to make
herself as artificial as the life she saw reflected
there.</p>

<p>Reaction with them is naturally as intense as
the previous excitement. A Kaffir who has been
risking his life so recklessly to defend his home,
will, when defeated, become wholly heedless of
what remains&mdash;wife and children, goods and
chattels, may perish before he will awake from
his prostration and stretch out a finger to save
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>I have seen a native deserter condemned to
be hanged, point to the men who were tying
the noose on the branch of a tree, and explain
by signs that the knot was too long for him to
freely swing between the branch and the ground.</p>

<p>I have seen another, wounded in the leg, and
unable to walk to the place of execution, when
placed on my pony to carry him there, urge on
the animal to the spot, and when the knot had
been placed round his neck, give the “click”
that sent the pony on and left him swinging
there.</p>

<p>A Kaffir woman, driven from her hut, refuses
to be burdened with her child on the march,
and if placed by force in her arms, will drop the
little thing on the first favourable occasion on
the roadside to die.</p>

<p>Men and women, huddled together as prisoners
after an engagement, appear utterly indifferent
to one another’s sufferings; the husband will
not share his rations with his wife (unless
ordered to do so), nor will she share hers with
him.</p>

<p>A Kaffir child will ask you for the beads you
have promised him for bringing you to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
hut in which you are going to shoot his own
father.</p>

<p>I have heard and seen many horrible things,
but this I must say, that the most atrocious
villains, and the most lovable beings on the
face of God’s earth, are to be found among the
white men. A more kind-hearted soul than
Sergeant Shelley could never be conceived; and
another man in my corps used to carry about,
concealed under his jacket, a broken reaping-hook,
to cut the throats of the women and
children we had taken prisoners on our night
expeditions.</p>

<p>As another proof of what men may become
in time of warfare, Dix one morning came to
inform me that I could not have my usual bath
in the small copper vat in which I had been
accustomed to take my matutinal tubbing.
Upon further inquiries I found that it had been
used for a purpose which I will attempt to
describe.</p>

<p>Doctor A&mdash;&mdash; of the 60th had asked my men
to procure him a few native skulls of both sexes.
This was a task easily accomplished. One morning
they brought back to camp about two dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
heads of various ages. As these were not supposed
to be in a presentable state for the doctor’s
acceptance, the next night they turned my vat
into a caldron for the removal of superfluous
flesh. And there these men sat, gravely smoking
their pipes during the live-long night, and
stirring round and round the heads in that
seething boiler, as though they were cooking
black-apple dumplings.</p>

<p>One morning two Kaffir boys, that had been
found by the men marauding on the outskirts of
our camp, were brought to me, and by the offer
I made of blankets and beads, were led to
promise they would guide us to where the
rest of the tribe lay concealed in a deep glen
between the stony ridges that ribbed off from
the Water-kloof heights. In furtherance of this
object I started with a small detachment of forty
men under Lieutenant Charlton. The summit
of the kloof was wrapped in heavy clouds, and
in passing through the hoary woods which
fringed the foot of the hill, grave doubts came
over me as to whether I was justified (now that
the war was ebbing to a close, and had taken a
decided turn in our favour) in thus tempting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
children to betray their parents; and as these
boys were cautiously feeling their way to the
front, like mute slot-hounds picking up an uncertain
trail, it appeared to me that we were
more like revengeful pursuers hunting down
poor fugitive slaves, than man going to meet
man and fight out our disputed rights in fair
play. God’s will be done! but the task assigned
to the white man is often a difficult one.</p>

<p>At one time he appears as a sort of legal hangman
in the name of Nature’s undefined laws;
at another, simply a murderer; at a third time,
as I hardly know which of the two. Nevertheless,
one conviction always comes back with a
desolating pertinacity amidst all my doubts, and
that is&mdash;we never can be equals, in peace or in
war; <em>one</em> of the two must give way; and as
neither will do so while life lasts, Death can be
the only arbitrator to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>Many and many a time have I held out the
hand of good-fellowship to the negro, but have
never felt him clasp mine with the same heartfelt
return. It has either been with a diffident
pressure, as though something still concealed
remained between us, or with a subtle slippery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
clasp, which gave one the idea of a snake wriggling
in the hand, seeking when and where to bite.</p>

<p>Thus communing with myself, I followed
hesitatingly the heels of the Kaffir children;
when they suddenly stopped, and pointing to
some faint glimmering lights that appeared, in
the murky atmosphere of the valley, to be far
off, but in reality were close at hand, asked for
the blankets I had promised, for there stood
the huts in which their parents slept whom
they had brought me to shoot! I halted the
men, and ordered them to lie down: and there
we lay, stretched out on the ground, within sixty
yards of the village, watching the Kaffirs come
out to tend their fires, and endeavour to conceal
the glare, as though afraid of attracting attention,
then cautiously looking round, retire to
rest again inside their little branch-covered huts.</p>

<p>While thus lying and watching to our front,
some cautious footsteps from the rear were
heard approaching, and several Kaffirs, finding
out their mistake too late to fall back, threaded
their way through our ranks as though the men
were but so many logs of wood instead of the
deadly foes they knew us to be. The last of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
these stragglers was leading a horse which
obliged him to stop, as the brute stood snorting
over one of the men&mdash;it refused to pass
by. At length it made a plunge forward, and
its heels coming disagreeably close to the man’s
head as it landed on the other side, he rose,
with a good hearty oath. The Kaffir, however,
proceeded stolidly on his way.</p>

<p>These Kaffirs stopped at the huts and spoke to
the people around them, but evidently did not
communicate the knowledge of our presence to
their friends, for they retired again quietly to rest.
My horse, Charlie&mdash;a good, sensible animal as
ever a man bestrode (it was the charger that
General Cathcart had given me)&mdash;having winded
the horse the Kaffir had lately led through our
ranks, threw off the hood his head was usually
covered with to prevent his attention being
drawn to other cattle while we were lying in
wait around villages, and began to neigh. Out
swarmed the Kaffirs like bees aroused harshly
from their hives. They evidently knew the
loud neighing of my entire horse did not proceed
from one of their small Kaffir ponies,
who, in their turn, were now replying to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Charlie. Before a minute had passed, our men
had opened fire, and the Kaffirs in return were
hurling back to us their assegais. This did not
last long. With a loud cheer the huts were
charged. Soon all was over; and after pulling
out the dead and the wounded, we set fire to
the village.</p>

<p>During the fight, a little Kaffir boy, who had
been curled up in a <em lang="af" xml:lang="af">kaross</em>, had received a bullet
in the sole of his foot, which, passing up the
leg, had smashed several inches of the bone. As
he was being rolled over and over whilst the
men were dragging the <em lang="af" xml:lang="af">kaross</em> from under him,
he explained to me, by signs, his impossibility
to rise. He stretched out his little bronzed
fingers towards me; and his childish, olive face,
lit up by the glare of the fire from the burning
hut, looked to me like the illuminated
countenance of the infant St John which one
often sees in medieval pictures, and I could
not help taking up the little fellow in my
arms and giving him a hearty kiss. I could
not leave him in his helpless condition; yet
how were we to get him back to the camp?
His leg was quite smashed. The man whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
I tipped with a sovereign to carry him, found
it dangling about in the most sickening manner,
and at last gave up the job. The only chance
left was to have an amputation performed. To
this the child submitted without a murmur;
and Dix, my cook, took the limb off at the
knee in a manner that would have astonished
a London surgeon. This was not the first
“case” on which Dix had tried his “’prentice
hand;” for some time past his vocation had
been that of head surgeon and barber in general
to the corps.</p>

<p>The little patient arrived eventually at the
camp all right; and it may perhaps interest
my readers to hear that a wooden leg was made
for him, on which he used to stump off extraordinary
Kaffir reels that might have given a new
idea to some of those bonnie Scotchmen who
indulge in the Highland fling. But the most
profitable feat for the little performer was the
following:&mdash;In a small stream that flowed some
two hundred yards in front of Blakeway’s Farm,
the men had made a large pond for bathing, by
sinking the bed of the river. Over it a small
platform was erected from which one might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
take a plunge. To this spot the little Kaffir
was led whenever visitors arrived at the camp
(and this often occurred, now that the war
was drawing to a close). There, one end of a
string being tied to his wooden leg, and the
other fastened to a fishing-rod, he popped into
the water like a large frog, and went down to
the bottom, while up rose his leg like a float.
Then began the exciting struggle of landing
this queer fish; and when this was achieved,
amid roars of laughter, a shower of coppers
was sure to make up for his ducking.</p>

<p>The country around Fort Beaufort had now
become so free from Kaffirs, that the men would
often, after roll-call, of an evening go in twos
and threes, without their firelocks, into the
town, and return again before next morning’s
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r&eacute;veill&eacute;</em>, laden with calibashes filled with Cape-smoke.
I may mention that this is the name
of an intoxicating liquor made from the prickly
pear or Cape cactus.</p>

<p>To prevent these irregular proceedings, Sergeant
Herridge used to patrol the road with
a party of men; and one evening he brought
back an old woman, two middle-aged ones,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and a young girl, whom he had found in a kloof
adjoining the before-mentioned road. The girl
was called “Noziah.” We soon found out that
she was no less important a personage than
the sister of the Kaffir chief Sandilli, who,
with “Macomo,” was the greatest opponent
to British power at the Cape. The old lady
was the principal attendant, the two others
the “lady-helps,” of the party. The former was
a most communicative personage. After relating
the splendour of the young damsel’s origin,
and the responsibilities under which she herself
laboured, as being the duenna to whose care
Sandilli had confided so incomparable a treasure,
she asked to be allowed to go on her way,
and report progress to her mighty chief. The
ancient dame was quite a character, and I felt
interested on her behalf; and explained, through
Johnny Fingo, that she was at perfect liberty to
go where she liked&mdash;adding that, during her
absence, I would look after the welfare of her
charge, and that Sandilli might expect to see
his sister return as she had been confided to
my care.</p>

<p>The old lady, after expressing, by profound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
salutations, her gratitude to me, was on the
point of departing, when Sergeant Herridge
remarked that she wore a wonderful necklace
of lions’ and leopards’ teeth strung together,
and that he would like to have it. On this
being explained to the old woman, she stoutly
refused to part with it, saying it was a charmed
token, an heirloom in her family, and had belonged
formerly to a great witch-doctor, of whom
she was the lineal descendant. There, for the
moment, ended the matter, and shortly afterwards
she started on her journey alone. Sergeant
Herridge was observed to follow her; and
just after she had disappeared behind the brow
of the hill that rose over Blakeway’s Farm towards
the Water-kloof, a shot was heard, and
the sergeant came back with his leather jacket
spattered with blood.</p>

<p>The next day the old woman’s body was
found; and as the men believed that she had
been murdered by Herridge, he was in consequence
shunned; for however brutally cruel
many of them were, killing without mercy all
that came in their way when engaged in fight,
young as well as old, even braining little children&mdash;yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
this was done against the supposed
deadly enemies of their race, and not in cold
blood for the sake of plunder.</p>

<p>It must not even be supposed that men could
be brought into this savage state of mind without
many harrowing causes of anger. I have
not related the many proofs we had had of
the fiendish ferocity of our foes. We had all
seen the victims, or the remains, of their abominable
tortures: women disembowelled, and their
unborn progeny laid before them; men mutilated,
and their amputated members placed in
derision to adorn their yet living bodies, their
wounds exposed to flies and maggots, and fated
to feel death thus crawling loathsomely over
them. All this had exasperated the men into
frenzy. We all knew what awaited us if we
fell into their power. It is true that people
at home, who descant quietly on the rights
of man, may have some difficulty in realising
the feelings of the men.</p>

<p>As this supposed case of murder was not
reported to me for several days, and when
at last I inspected the place where the deed
was said to have been committed, the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
woman’s body had been so much eaten up by
jackals, &amp;c., as to be no longer recognisable
as to which sex it belonged, I left the matter
alone. Herridge in the meantime stoutly denied
to all that he had committed the crime.
About a month afterwards he expressed a wish
to leave the corps and rejoin the police. Knowing
his, to say the least of it, uncomfortable position,
I allowed him to do so, giving him letters
stating the services he had rendered during the
war, to facilitate his readmission into the police
force, from whence he had in reality deserted.</p>

<p>This is one instance of the many <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laches</em>
which occurred in my corps, and which, as the
authorities took no positive notice of it, I was
only too glad to pretend to ignore.</p>

<p>On my return to England in the following
spring, I was asked, on passing through
Graham’s Town, to go and visit a man then
lying in the hospital there, and who had
formerly belonged to my corps. I accordingly
went, and found the man to be Sergeant
Herridge. I was shocked to see the emaciated
state to which his powerful frame had been
reduced, and the haggard, shifting look of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
once fearless eye. His right hand and arm
had withered to the bone; and as he held it
propped up with the other before me, he said,
“That did it, sir; the Almighty has blasted it;
the old woman is revenged. I knew by the
look she gave me when dying that all was
not settled between us; but she has never left
gnawing at that arm since, and now she is
sucking away at my brains. Tell me, sir,
will she leave me alone when I am dead?”</p>

<p>Poor Herridge! His deed was a cruel one,
and he suffered cruelly for it. Doctor B&mdash;&mdash; of
the 12th, who attended him, remarked that he
had never seen a case in which the power of
the mind so visibly affected the body. When
first brought under his charge, the man merely
complained of rheumatism in the arm, and insisted
on the fact that it was drying it up; and
in the course of two months, during which he
was continually staring at it, it had in effect
withered to the bone.

<p class="hang">NOZIAH AT BLAKEWAY’S FARM&mdash;BECOMES A FAVOURITE WITH THE
MEN&mdash;WISHES TO RECONCILE ME TO HER BROTHER SANDILLI&mdash;EXPEDITION
SENT OUT TO FIND SANDILLI AND ARRANGE FOR AN
INTERVIEW&mdash;RETURNS AFTER TWENTY-THREE DAYS’ ABSENCE&mdash;I GO
WITH NOZIAH TO MEET HER BROTHER&mdash;SANDILLI’S WAR-COUNCIL&mdash;ANGRY
RECEPTION&mdash;I OBTAIN A HEARING&mdash;SANDILLI’S REPLY&mdash;OFFERS
TO MEET GENERAL CATHCART AND MAKE AN EXPLANATION
TO HIM&mdash;DEMORALISING EFFECT OF EXPOSING LIFE IN FIGHTING.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Noziah had made herself very comfortable
at Blakeway’s Farm, and had picked
up enough Dutch and English words to make
her wishes known to me on most subjects.
There was a certain charm about the dusky
maiden, who possessed all the subtle graces
of her tribe. She soon became the presiding
deity of our camp. To her all appealed in
time of sickness or want; none could refuse
a request that came from her lips, and none
was more willing than myself to submit to
her winning guidance. I thought thereby I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
was acknowledging the influence of a power
best calculated to bring all races under British
sway. As our intimacy increased, she became
possessed of the fixed desire to make me the
friend of her brother Sandilli. She was so
persistent and persuading in this matter that
I finally arranged that a party under the guidance
of Johnny Fingo should proceed to that
chief’s quarter, and that Noziah should be my
delegate on this embassy, to arrange an interview
between her brother and me.</p>

<p>This was not exactly in keeping with the
etiquette that prevails between belligerents, and
I have no doubt that legal authority could
easily prove I was in the wrong. But General
Cathcart was in Basutoland, and his last words
before leaving had been an injunction to keep
matters quiet round the Water-kloof in any way
I thought most advisable.</p>

<p>This left me a wide margin, which I used in
sending the above-named party out in an unknown
direction and with a somewhat visionary
object in view; for, after all, no one knew
where Sandilli was, or the mood in which he
might be, if found at all. So, half hesitatingly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
I sent them on their way. Dix, who was a
passionate admirer of the gentle sex, of all
shades and shapes (always excepting his frail
better-half at Cape Town), had become a
devoted follower of one of Noziah’s attendants,
and was to have been leader of the
band; his heart, however, failed him at the
last moment, and he contented himself with
a passionate embrace of this his latest flame,
vowing, in high Kaffir-Dutch, that time or
distance could never extinguish the fire that
burnt in his breast.</p>

<p>Johnny Fingo was thus left in full command.
He had heard that Sandilli lay somewhere concealed
in the Ama Ponda Mountains, behind
Fort Alice. In that direction they accordingly
wended their way; and after an absence of
three-and-twenty days, Noziah returned with
the news that Sandilli was in the Water-kloof,
not six miles off, and there awaited my coming.</p>

<p>Her eagerness for our interview seemed so
catching, and she had such fears that her
brother might decamp once more&mdash;she knew
not where&mdash;that I determined to carry out her
wishes immediately. I had unbounded confidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
in her loyalty to me; but I had not, by
any means, the same reliance on the good faith
of her brother, who bore a character for fierceness
and treachery by no means reassuring.
However, accompanied by her, an attendant,
and Dix, I started for the interview, which
it was intended should take place in the
rocks so often mentioned before as the Blacksmith’s
Shop, and which had formed so prominent
a feature in General Cathcart’s description
of clearing out the Water-kloof.</p>

<p>I left Johnny Fingo in the camp. Something
in his demeanour since his return, and in his
manner of relating what had happened during
the expedition, appeared to me suspicious. He
was like a big black snake whose poisoned
fangs I knew that I had extracted at one time,
but I was not sure as to whether or not they
had grown to be dangerous again during his
late absence; at all events, I thought him safer
at home than with me.</p>

<p>It was late at night when we arrived on the
heights above the kloof, so I determined, after
stumbling about over rocks and monkey-rope
creepers for some time, to encamp where we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
were for the night. A most merciful dispensation
of Providence it was that we did so;
for not ten yards farther on we should have
fallen over a perpendicular cliff several hundred
feet to the bottom. In fact, we slept on
the brink of a rapid slope, not ten yards in
length, that led to this fearful death.</p>

<p>The next morning early we arrived near the
rocks we were in search of; and halting in a
tolerably open space, I sent on Noziah to warn
her brother of our arrival. It was rather an
anxious moment. I could see by the smoke
still wreathing about several still-smouldering
fires, that more than one party lay concealed
somewhere near those huge black rocks. But
whether a volley of musketry or friendly Kaffirs
were to issue from them, I felt by the thumping
of my heart that the question was being sharply
debated within. However, my anxious doubting
was soon over; for Noziah came back, accompanied
by a tall, limping figure, who gravely
held out his hand to me.</p>

<p>I was anxious to be on friendly terms with
this man. Noziah’s brother was an interesting
being to me. Her courage, handsome person,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and devotedness were making rapid strides into
my affections; and notwithstanding that Sandilli
was far from a desirable-looking acquaintance,
I strove by the hearty grasp I gave him
to prove how anxious I was to become better
acquainted.</p>

<p>We now proceeded to the rocks, Dix bringing
up the rear, with orders from me to shoot the
first person who committed an act of open
treachery. There were here about twenty Kaffirs.
We were soon seated on the ground&mdash;Sandilli,
Noziah, and myself, the centre of a circle
which these men formed about us. Dix was
stationed outside the circle, gun in hand. The
difficulties of entering into good-fellowship
with Sandilli now became apparent; for notwithstanding
the beseeching looks of Noziah,
he remained dumbly staring at me in the
rudest manner, and I could see nothing but
suppressed rage written on his ugly countenance.
The other members of his council&mdash;mostly
old men, who remained squatted on
their hands like savage grizzly bears&mdash;looked
askance at me with their bloodshot eyes, as
though they would like nothing better than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
pulling me to pieces. Feeling thus too disagreeably
scrutinised, I told Dix to point his gun, as
if by accident, somewhere near Sandilli’s head.
This movement considerably smoothed down
the very distorted features of that dark gentleman.
He said something in Kaffir to Noziah,
pointing to Dix, and I told the latter to move
his firelock a little on one side.</p>

<p>After this mute episode snuff was passed
round, and the conversation opened. I explained
in Dutch that I had been led to this
interview with the hope of stopping further
shedding of blood; that the late engagements
between my men and the Kaffirs had been more
like the slaughtering of cattle than an honest
struggle between man and man; they (the
Kaffirs) had no ammunition, and very few guns
left; it was worse than madness to suppose that
a piece of stick, blessed by a witch-doctor, could
drive, as they pretended, the English into the
sea,&mdash;in fact, I argued that it was a duty for
Sandilli, and well worthy his great influence, to
order his blind followers not to sacrifice themselves
any longer to such a senseless enterprise.</p>

<p>Sandilli replied in a curious mingling of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Dutch, English, and Kaffir, of which Noziah
acted as interpreter, that it was not he who had
begun the war: years and years ago his father
had to defend his kraal against General Maitland
on the Sunday River, many long marches
from where we then sat; that from that day to
this several wars had occurred between his tribe
and the English; but they were always brought
on in the defence of their homes. In this manner
they had been successively driven from one
place to another, until there was nothing left for
them but the hills. They were not hillmen,
but wanted the pasture-lands in the plains from
whence they had been driven, and which were
now given to English farmers and cowardly
Fingoes. He, for his part, was willing to make
peace, because they could not fight against my
men, who attacked them by night when they
slept. During the day they were not afraid, as
they had proved to Sir Harry Smith. He had
been told that the Basutos had been beaten by
General Cathcart: it was a good thing, because
they were fools not to have come to his (Sandilli’s)
help when he had nearly driven the
English into the sea, where they came from.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
He added that, if Macomo was willing, they
would go together and meet General Cathcart,
and explain these matters to him, trusting that
something like an equable arrangement might be
made for those of his tribe who remained.</p>

<p>I promised to send on this proposal of his to
General Cathcart; and it was, moreover, arranged
that Noziah should remain in my camp to convey
the General’s reply to Sandilli when received.
Noziah also made her brother swear,
over some piece of stick she held before him,
that she should not be sacrificed for remaining
with the English (she had often told me that
that disagreeable fate awaited her). To this,
after many a mysterious sign and token, he
agreed, to my immense relief, and the party
broke up. I had felt, to say the least of
it, exceedingly uneasy during the somewhat
lengthy interview. Noziah afterwards told me
that one of the party had actually proposed
that I should be bound and tortured to death,
as a propitiation to their witch-doctors, for
the spirits of those who had perished by my
night attacks. It was, perhaps, the firelock
of Dix, pointed towards Sandilli’s head, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
prevented the carrying out of this Kaffir-like
attention.</p>

<p>On returning to camp I found a small party
of men who had been all night seeking us.
They had caught a Kaffir, belonging probably to
Sandilli’s party, seated near the spot where we
had slept that night, and around which lay
strewn remnants of a newspaper in which Dix
had wrapped our late meal. They concluded
from these shreds that we had been pitched
over the cliff, and that these tokens of civilisation
were all that remained of their captain, and,
in revenge, they had hanged the poor devil on
an adjoining tree.</p>

<p>It was really high time that the war should
come to a speedy end. The knowledge that
this end was close at hand had sadly relaxed
discipline. The stirring events of war had left
a craving for excitement not easily satisfied.
Life had been so freely exposed, that it was
looked upon as of very hazardous value. Men
were ready to give or take it on the most trivial
pretexts. I have seen a party of my own men
firing at one another, at long distances, from behind
rocks, merely to find out the range of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Minie rifles. At other times I have known them
throw assegais at one another for the same
purpose, and more than once inflict dangerous
wounds.</p>

<p>I naturally had more difficulty in keeping my
men in order than other officers experienced in
that part of the colony. My men were a rougher
lot, and had only enlisted for a war that they
now considered finished: Lieut. H&mdash;&mdash; had resigned;
Lieut. &mdash;&mdash; had been sent about his
business; Lieut. P&mdash;&mdash; was often as riotous as
the men; Lieut. C&mdash;&mdash; was too young and reckless
to possess the tact and persistent energy
necessary for the management of so unruly a
set with security to himself or satisfaction to
them.

<p>General Cathcart now returned from his
Basutoland expedition, where British soldiers
proved once more their many sterling qualities.
I shall not, however, attempt to describe the
work done, for I had no actual share in it. The
war now, so far as active operations were concerned,
had virtually come to an end; my own
occupation was gone. “Grim-visaged war had
smoothed his wrinkled front,” as humpbacked
Richard said, and I began to seek for excitement
in a quarter which had always possessed
attractions for me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>Hitherto my experiences of sport at the Cape
had been of a somewhat tame description, consisting
of coursing and partridge-shooting, such
as I had often enjoyed, though on a larger
scale, in Old England. But at that time my
thoughts were on larger subjects bent, and I
gave myself up thoroughly to these. My battery
consisted of a Lancaster double-barrelled,
oval-bored rifle, of great precision and length
of range, but small in calibre; a Rigby twelve-bored
fowling-piece; and a double-barrelled Barnett
Minie, also twelve-bored. With these I
bowled over lots of fur and feather, mostly pea-fowl,
stein and bush buck. Sometimes I went
in for bigger game; but as there were no lion,
elephant, or buffalo within several days’ journey,
I was obliged to content myself with trying my
’prentice hand on some stray leopards, whose
tracks I had noticed about, as well as those of
wild-boar, or rather, as I believe, of farmers’ pigs
run wild during the war, and which in very fair
numbers ploughed up the wet kloofs and the
abandoned gardens around the farms.</p>

<p>There were plenty of hyenas and jackals
about, but I was tired of trying to get up any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
excitement about them. They were a set of
sneaking marauders, who used to prowl about
the camp by night for the sake of the offal and
scraps to be found, and who would scamper
off on the slightest appearance of danger. My
English spaniel, “Dash,” would often bow-wow
them almost any distance away.</p>

<p>Amongst other traces of game, I had observed
the spoor of a leopard, or some other soft-footed
member of the feline tribe, around a pool of
water at the head of the kloof on which Blakeway’s
Farm was situated. It was about two miles
off, in a very dank, secluded spot, almost as dark
under the big cliffs and heavy foliage as an underground
cavern. It was a favourite resort for
blue-buck and baboons, whose footprints had
stamped and puddled the ground all around.
I selected a spot under a boulder of rock that
advanced almost to the margin of the pool,
where I placed, day after day, as I had seen it
done in Algeria, branch after branch of prickly
cactus, until I had made quite a porcupine shield,
big enough to shelter a man. In the centre of
this I dug a small circular hole, for a seat,
and ensconced thereon, I one night took my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
place, awaiting the arrival of my supposed
game.</p>

<p>The grandeur of the scenery, huge grey rocks,
gigantic trees, and an awe-inspiring stillness
which weighed upon one’s spirits, made me feel
extremely small in my solitary hole. The only
life moving amid these gloomy surroundings
was a merry singing cloud of mosquitoes, circling
round and round above my head. Had
I not remembered the enormous bumps their
whispering kisses used to raise on my poor
face, I should have felt tempted to let some of
them in under the muslin I had spread across
the bushes overhead, in order to have something
to occupy my attention and break the monotony,
were it only these denizens of the insect world.</p>

<p>About three hundred yards lower down in
the valley I had left the attendant who usually
accompanied me on my shooting expeditions.
His name was Napoleon&mdash;a name given to him
by the men on account of his being a native of
St Helena, and from the fact of his bearing a
supposed likeness to his illustrious namesake.
He held in leash two half-bred Scotch deer-hounds,
that were to be slipped on the report
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of my gun. They were fine, strong-limbed
animals, capable of pulling down almost any
big game. Napoleon himself was a bold, willing
fellow, on whom I knew I could place
entire reliance. He was as widely awake to a
stray Kaffir as to game. I have seen him more
than once, when bush-buck had been brought to
bay, go in in the pluckiest manner, and, to save
the dogs, often risk his own life. Bush-buck,
I may mention, have fearfully pointed, spiral-shaped
horns, and have been known to make
fatal use of them when driven to desperation.</p>

<p>Thus, far from all the world, I mutely sat,
communing with the great voice of Nature
around, and to the faint promptings of my
small nature within. I felt and remained like
a log, or rather, like the sober Irishman who
entreated somebody to tread on the tail of his
coat, if only for the sake of getting up a mild
excitement.</p>

<p>I was roused from this stupor by some visitors
to the pool, in the shape of two little land-tortoises,
that came wabbling down, one after
the other, as fast as their small groggy legs
would carry them. On arriving at the water’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
edge, they launched forth, like boats from a
slip, and floated about, side by side, as lovingly
as the twin ship the Calais-Douvres on the
Channel. They were, no doubt, a newly-married
couple. It might even have been their marriage
trip, as they seemed as much over head and ears
in love as in water. There they were, turtling
about at leap-frog, heads up and tails down, in
rocking-horse fashion; and now and then, as
though ashamed of such mad pranks, they
would dive underneath the surface, and shyly
begin playing bo-peep with one another among
the sedges of the pond. But alas! all things
must come to an end, and I have heard it said
that even husbands and wives get tired of one
another, though Hymen forbid that I should
give credence to such a report! And now, at
this moment, a huge bat came lazily flapping
its wings, like a sea-gull, over the water, and
warned, I presume, the innocent creatures that
night was approaching, and that it was time for
respectable couples to seek the security of their
own homes. So they left their luxurious water-couch,
and wabbled off, as demurely as Darby
and Joan going to evening chapel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile evening was putting up its revolving
shutters, leaving me more and more
benighted, and my thoughts were turned into
another direction by catching at intervals the
distant barking of the bush-buck, as they replied
to one another, and who, like most swaggering
challengers, kept each other at a respectful
distance. A distant hum arose from the direction
of the camp, as confused as the medley of
races it contained&mdash;Russian, Swede, French,
German, English, and Dutch&mdash;men from all
climes, held strangely together by the mere force
of my frail will. This thought, and other
equally dim ones, occupied my mind, when the
loud lapping of water close at hand caught my
attentive ear, and brought me, with a startling
throb, to the realities of my then actual undertaking.
Straining my eyes in the direction
from whence the sound came, I fancied, in the
dusk, I could trace the outline of a beast of
some sort on the brink of the pond. Slowly
raising my gun in that direction, I was on the
point of pulling the trigger, when the sound of
lapping ceased.</p>

<p>Grave doubts now arose in my mind as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
whether that at which I was levelling my gun
was a living object or not, for in the gathering
darkness, rocks, reeds, and bushes had assumed
the most fantastic shapes. I became
confused as to which of them I should direct
my aim. At length I resolved to creep from
my hiding-place, and for this purpose placed
the small leather cushion on which I was seated
on my head, and endeavoured to lift the prickly
bush above. I was thus engaged when I received
a fearful whop upon my head, which
knocked me over, bushes and all, while some
heavy brute passed over my prostrate form,
landing me a prickly cropper upon my own
porcupine shield. Off went the gun haphazard,
and I scrambled to my feet as best I could. I
was just recovering my senses, when up came
the dogs, sniffing and scenting the air. They,
however, appeared as bewildered as myself, and
at last slunk away between my legs. Napoleon
followed, blundering as fast as the darkness
would permit him through the deep ravine;
and on his inquiry as to what I had fired at, I
told him to go to the devil and see! He lit a
match and looked into the prickly bush from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
which I had been so ruthlessly turned out. We
found, near the edge of the pool, the deeply
indented footing where some heavy beast had
landed on springing from the rocks overhead.
There could be no doubt in our minds that they
were made by the leopard I had been waiting
for. On Napoleon expressing some doubts as
to whether or not the same beast might not be
now waiting for us, we left in a most hasty and
undignified manner the scene of my late skirmish.
The result of my first interview was not
of an engaging nature; and I made up my mind
that the next time I arranged for a meeting, it
should be on terms which, at least, offered more
elbow-room.</p>

<p>The great sportsman at the camp was a man
called Watson. He had been a keeper in England.
He was master of all sorts of dodges for
trapping, shooting, and stuffing of game. He
had observed, near an abandoned cattle-kraal at
a neighbouring farm, a large pool of stagnant
water, around which he had made out, amid the
many marks of wild animals, the spoor of a
leopard, which he pretended was the same brute
that had given me such a boxing-lesson in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
kloof. Dix, Watson, and Nap now set to work
to sink a hole not far from the pond, around
which they placed a circle of bushes. They
made, however, such a dense turret, that it was
impossible to obtain an entrance into it. I explained
to them that the only way for me to
gain admittance would be for one of them to be
tied with a rope, and then, bodkin-fashion, to
be pushed through the prickly bush to make an
entrance. This plan, however, did not quite
satisfy them.</p>

<p>The only other method of proceeding was to
throw their leather jackets on the top of the
turret, and to place myself thereon. This pin-cushion
was not, however, stout enough, and let
the thorns through; so, after several attempts,
in which I got severely pricked somewhere for
my pains, I gave the setting dodge up. It was
finally decided that the turret was to be removed;
that we were to station ourselves at
various parts of the building, a couple of goats
being attached in a prominent place to attract
the leopard to the spot, and a volley from us
all was to settle the question. In accordance
with this suggestion, the next day the goats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
were brought, and pegged down, as we had
previously determined. Dix had also brought
some fowls, which he pretended, by their crowing,
would greatly enhance the chance of attracting
the leopard’s attention. We persisted
in this plan for several days, but with so little
promise of success, that I thought the odds were
more in favour of attracting stray Kaffirs towards
us, and being made game of ourselves.
This not answering my sporting programme, I
returned to the original plan of placing myself
in the hole, which was sufficiently deep to conceal
me; and there, without covering of any
sort, to await the advent of any four-footed
beast that would kindly come to the rendezvous.</p>

<p>On the night of the fourth day of kneeling
attention I really saw a leopard slowly approaching
the pond. I had an undeniable proof of his
nature by the scampering away of several heads of
antelope that had been near the pond, and by the
loud quacking of a flock of wild-duck then swimming
thereon. The brute walked leisurely round
the pond until he came to within about twenty
yards of the spot where I was lying concealed,
when he suddenly disappeared as if by magic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
In vain I strove to discover any signs of his
whereabouts. I then partly got out of my hole,
and there, kneeling on the edge, I could dimly
see his flattened form. Now, what was to be
done? He offered no fair mark for my rifle. I
was afraid, in that uncertain light, to go nearer
him; and he, on his side, decided on not coming
nearer me. I passed what seemed to me a very
long and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tr&egrave;s mauvais quart d’heure</em> in this
anxious state; the night was closing in fast,
the moon would not be up until very late, and
I really knew not what to do. In this uncertainty
I crept backwards towards the bushes,
thrown on one side, that had been lately employed
in the construction of the before-mentioned
turret.</p>

<p>Once arrived there, the same habit of protecting
myself, which no doubt I had acquired
by imitation from French sportsmen in Algeria,
led me to try and cover my rear as safely as possible.
With this view I went to work most energetically,
but found the task, from the nature of
the obstacles I had to overcome, very disagreeable;
for, as hard as I had pushed my way in, the
prickly thorns seemed to combine as strongly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
spur me out. This kicking against pricks once
decided in my favour, by finding that I had
succeeded, after all, in making room for concealment,
my courage rose in the same proportion
towards the foe to my front. I not only
got so excited as to make all sorts of unearthly
yells to challenge the brute to stand up, to come
on, &amp;c., but actually finished by throwing bits
of stick and brushwood at him, in the hopes of
bringing the sulky brute to the scratch. But
he was not going to be made game of, so, in
despair, I left off hallooing, and called out to
Dix (who, I afterwards found out, was at that
moment soundly snoozing with Napoleon at the
farm) to come to the rescue. These heavy-headed
sleepers were not even dreaming of my
state of <em>funk</em>, and, of course, did not stir.</p>

<p>At length, thoroughly exhausted, I laid myself
flat on the ground to get a lower-level view
of the horizon, and there, with my gun pointed
to the front, and a stout assegai at my side, I
awaited what might happen.</p>

<p>How long I remained I never knew, but it
must have been a long time, for I was getting
intensely cold lying on the ground covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
a heavy dew,&mdash;when, more by sound than by
sight, I felt the gradual creeping of something
towards me. However unmoved I might have
remained until now, the loud thumping of my
heart against the ground at this juncture became
intolerable; so, with a loud shout, I jumped up,
and, with an ominous growl, the animal bounded
into the bush a few yards on my right. I at
once sent a shot in that direction, which caused
a fearful uproar and scattering of bushes. Without
stopping to consider, I at once sent another
shot towards the same spot, and suddenly all
was silent. This not being reassuring, and as
I had now no positive sign to show where the
brute was, I fell back, loading, towards the farm.
Here I met the men coming towards me; and
after hastily explaining to them the position of
affairs, we proceeded, torches in hand, towards
the spot, to make a fuller investigation of what
had taken place.</p>

<p>Here we found a fine male leopard lying dead.
The first bullet I fired had broken the spine,
near his hind quarters; and the second shot,
composed of slugs, had taken effect in the head,
and proved a speedy quietus. I believe this to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
have been the only leopard in the district, as
neither the men nor I ever saw the spoor of
one afterwards.</p>

<p>My experience of wild-boar shooting was more
profitable in the shape of hams and chine than
as to actual enjoyment of what is called real
sport. I could never get them to charge home;
and although I have shot little porkers that
have raised an awful amount of squealing, yet
even the sow-mother, and the rest of the herd,
would start off in the opposite direction. Once
or twice it happened that they came towards
me within about twenty yards, but then they
would invariably be off to the right or the left.
If, however, they showed so little pluck when
facing the gun, they had plenty of it when
opposed to dogs alone.</p>

<p>I have often seen them chasing mine (and
they were a stout pack) for a long distance.
Upon one occasion a “souzer” of pigs chased my
dogs almost into the camp, and the men had to
turn out to drive them off.</p>

<p>I never took any pleasure in shooting baboons
or monkeys; and, except to defend myself on
two different occasions, never fired a shot at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
them. On the first occasion, I had been gathering
bulbs of those red-pennoned, lance-shaped
flowers, which are much admired in some parts
of South Africa. I had been so intent on my
task that I had forgotten my dogs, that always
accompanied me, now the war was virtually
over, in my strolls through the country.</p>

<p>The dogs were a very scratched pack. They
were in all about twenty, mostly of Kaffir origin,
of various sizes, from a huge Danish mastiff,
called Woden, to my little Sussex spaniel Dash.
The ruling spirits were four Scotch deer-hounds,
three of which I had purchased from Mr Andersen,
my Norwegian friend at Cape Town. The
other had been given to me by P&mdash;&mdash;r of the
Commissariat. Dhula, the biggest and bravest
of Andersen’s Scotch leash, would not only pull
down the largest bush-buck, but would also
keep guard afterwards, and prevent my Kaffir
dogs eating it. Many an antelope had he thus
saved to grace our frugal board, and to afford a
display of Dix’s culinary art. Poor Dhula! his
life was embittered by his jealousy of Woden.
The latter, although a heavy dog, ran well; and
often, while chasing, when the chance offered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
he would run at Dhula, and, striking him under
the shoulder as he would a deer, bowl the astonished
Scotch giant over and over, much to the
latter’s disgust.</p>

<p>Woden evidently could never quite understand
the humour of his Scotch congener. He
generally gave in to Dhula, but often after
several sharp bouts, in which he always carried
off the worst of the biting in the heavy folds of
his shaggy throat. My Kaffir greyhounds would
run anything and eat anything they caught,
from a startled quail to a porcupine. They
were as crafty as they were cruel and fleet, and
in the woods ran as much by scent as by sight.
They were not, however, equal in speed to my
English dogs. My plucky little friend Dash
was (considering his small offensive powers) the
bravest of the brave; for his winning way of
bringing stones or anything else he could pick
up to you, whenever he wanted a caress, or some
little tit-bit to eat, had completely ground down
his teeth to an unbrushable size. If it came to
a regular go-in with some struggling beast
brought to bay, Dash would lie down, and,
twisting his knowing head about as the various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
ups and downs of the fight took place, looked
like an old amateur boxer observing professional
gluttons at work. Dash was buried on Blakeway’s
kloof, which had so often echoed to his
lively tongue. A blue-faced baboon, as I am
now going to relate, was the malevolent spirit
which loosened all his worldly ties between his
much-attached master and his love for all sports&mdash;for
Dash was as much alive to the pleasure of
hunting rats at a farm-rick in Old England as
in chasing jackals and hyenas round our camp
at the Cape.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative, however. As above
stated, in the ardour of digging bulbs, I had
forgotten my dogs, when Napoleon called my
attention to their baying far down in the recesses
of the kloof. Hastily picking up my
gun, lying close at hand, and he hurriedly
cramming without mercy into a sack my green-grocery-looking
bunches of roots, we started
off in hot haste to the spot to which the dogs
were calling our attention. On our way we
met them coming back; they were, however,
eagerly enough disposed to return, so that we
knew by that sign the object of their late <em>rencontre</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
was not supposed by them to be very
far off.</p>

<p>And so it was, for we soon found ourselves
amidst a grinning lot of large, brown, Cape
baboons. They were clinging up aloft to the
graceful creepers that festoon so beautifully the
trees in South African woods, and looking like
so many hideous, hairy-bellied spiders on a
beautiful lace-work of Nature’s weaving. I
felt inclined to give some of them, who looked
particularly out of place in that sylvan retreat,
a peppering of shot; but their wonderful performances
on the tight-ropes around them soon
smoothed the wrinkles of my indignation. These
acrobats performed extraordinary feats. They
shot from branch to branch, from wave to wave,
like flying-fish, or as pantless Zazel shoots from
the cannon’s mouth to her swinging rope.</p>

<p>This performance created intense excitement,
and the barking of the dogs seemed to applaud
this aerial description of St Vitus’s Dance. It
was really affecting to see the solicitude of the
parents as their little progeny hopped from tree
to tree after them, now holding out their arms
to receive them as they landed, now thrusting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
back a creeper to bring it nearer within their
reach. It was a real exhibition of baboon agility,
of which we see but a faint parody in the
Westminster Aquarium, by the Darwinian selections
among the human bipeds.</p>

<p>An accident befalling a clumsy little fellow as
he stumbled on the branch of an iron-wood tree,
he came to the ground with a thud. In one
minute the poor chap was torn to pieces by the
dogs. This was more than his parents could
stand; down they came to the ground, followed
closely by the rest of the tribe, and a real battle
ensued between them and the dogs.</p>

<p>The baboons got the best of the fight,&mdash;poor
Woden was ridden off the field by two jabbering
jockeys on his back, who laboured his sides
most unmercifully with tooth and nail. Dhula
was too nimble and clever with his teeth to be
caught, nevertheless he had to submit from his
many persecutors with the loss of several inches
of his tail. Fly, a remarkably fine red Kaffir
bitch, which I afterwards took home and gave
to the Zoological Gardens, was ripped up and
her sides laid bare. But the worst of all occurred
to poor Dash: he was carried of by a huge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
baboon almost as big as a totty, and I arrived
to his rescue too late. I saw that he was dead,
and forthwith shot his destroyer upon him.
Napoleon made good use of his assegai and my
spade; and after a fight far more exciting than
glorious, we remained masters of the field.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced, had the baboons
shown any unity of action, I should not have
been relating this incident to-day.</p>

<p>These are about the only events in my sporting
life at the Cape worthy of narration; many
milder incidents occurred which I pass over,
judging them insufficient to be of interest to
the reader.</p>

<p>I know but little about snakes&mdash;they were of
almost everyday acquaintance; but as neither
my men nor I were ever bitten by one, I have
nothing sensational to write about them. One
short episode I may perhaps relate. In creeping
over some rocks to have a shot at a stein-buck,
I cautiously looked over a ledge of stone,
and fancying there was a curious garlic smell
about the place, I looked down, and there,
lazily stretched out at full length, almost touching
my throat, was a huge cobra di capello.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
I drew back much less hesitatingly than I had
peeped, and, retiring a few feet, shot it as it
was rearing its head in the act of preparing
to strike. This little event gave the hitherto
slight attention I had paid them a more repulsive
form, and ever afterwards I destroyed all
that came in my way. Up to that day I had
handled them as I had seen others do&mdash;henceforth
their touch became too loathsome.
Kaffirs believe that after a puff-adder, whip-snake,
or cobra has bitten, it must within a
short space of time wash out its mouth with
water (which these snakes invariably do, if it is
at hand), else it would die from the poison
that oozes afterwards from its fangs. They also
think that white men, if bitten by snakes, invariably
cause the death of the snake itself&mdash;for
they say the white man’s blood is poisonous to
all serpents.

<p>Kaffir witchcraft assumes so many fantastic
forms, that it is difficult to give a notion as to
any guiding principle in it. Hatred of the
European seems to play a large part in all their
superstitions.</p>

<p>A piece of stick is supposed, after blessing and
incantations, to become a talisman, having the
power to save the wearer from all danger the
white man can attempt to inflict against him;
but it is thought to be powerless in warding
off a danger coming from a neighbouring tribe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
They believe that we are born of the foam of the
sea, and we should all perish if driven back to
our ships, which they suppose to be the cradles
in which we are brought up. Like almost all
magicians, they believe they can raise plagues
of all sorts, and inflict sores and different forms
of leprosy by merely casting an evil eye upon
any one.</p>

<p>Their knowledge of medicine and surgery is
greater than may be supposed. I have known
them cure headaches and neuralgia, hitherto
incurable, by putting a leather band round the
head, and adding underneath small smooth
pebbles at certain distances, then placing a
weight upon the head, which is usually a bowl
of supposed mesmerised water, weighing down
the whole until the head becomes completely
numbed, and all pain ceases.</p>

<p>Two or three applications of this nature I
know to be, from actual observation, a positive
cure. They also know the use of several medicines,
such as emetics, &amp;c.; and in surgery will
stop the bleeding of an artery as well as any
surgeon&mdash;applying wet bandages wrapped round
smooth stones, which act as efficiently as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
tourniquet. They will also amputate the small
joints with great skill.</p>

<p>The Kaffir customs are far more artificial than
one would suppose from his ease of manner;
every position of the body has been taught him
from his childhood. Whenever Kaffir men or
women present themselves before you, it is in
the attitude they have been instructed as the
most becoming for the furtherance of their
wishes. A man who comes to ask for a favour
which concerns the welfare of any member of his
family, takes quite a different attitude than when
offering to exchange something in barter. The
young man who seeks to purchase the hand of his
wife, has certain modes of well-defined expression
in the attitude he assumes, whether hesitating or
assured of success. The triumphal swagger of a
suitor who has been successful in such a mission
is something marvellous to behold&mdash;it really
seems as if he thought the earth would soil his
feet as he treads upon it. On the other hand,
if he has been refused, and has no hopes of making
a second more enticing offer, he will retire
in such hang-dog fashion as to make his worst
enemy inclined to pity him. The man who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
stands before you leaning gracefully upon his
assegai, in a posture that even a sculptor might
dream of as the embodiment of manhood and
grace, is not what you might suppose in a position
taught by nature’s school, but the summing
up of what generations have thought to be the
beau-ideal of a man.</p>

<p>Johnny Fingo once presented himself before
me in so calm and dignified a manner that he
quite surprised me; and upon my asking him
the nature of the business he came upon, he
replied that he was the bearer of a communication
from Sandilli. No Roman presenting himself
on the part of the senate, bringing an offer
of peace or war to a foreign potentate, could
have done so with more calm assurance of the
mighty import of his mission.</p>

<p>The women are small in shape and frame
compared with the men, and extremely beautiful,
as far as the moulding of the limbs is concerned;
but their features will not bear the same
close inspection. Winsome, coy, and to a certain
degree striking when young, they become
snappish, coarse, and ungainly as they advance
in years. Noziah, of whom mention has already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
been made, was far handsomer than the ordinary
women of her tribe (Timbuctoo), and betrayed
her birth by her stately carriage and the extreme
delicacy of her hands and feet. Her mental
capacity was equal to that of any untutored
woman I ever came in contact with; she understood
thoroughly the intricate policy then being
carried out at the Cape, the position of the Dutch
and English settlers, and the use the Kaffirs
might make of these two antagonistic interests
for their own profit. She also was well aware
of the task the missionary was performing, the
progress of English civilisation, and the good
and evil that it was then bringing into the land.
In short, she was a woman capable of undertaking
any noble task which Providence in its
wisdom might have thought necessary.</p>

<p>General Cathcart now returned from his
Basutoland expedition. Macomo and Sandilli
had made peace with the British authorities upon
terms that neither they nor the colonists could
then or afterwards exactly make out. All that
seemed perfectly clear was, that when the English
Government had made up its mind as to
the delimitations of territory, &amp;c., that decision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
would be duly signified to all interested; and
let the terms be as onerous or as arbitrary, as
stupid or as wise, as the authorities at home
could devise, they had to be accepted.</p>

<p>My corps having no further <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’&ecirc;tre</em> was
disbanded, and a most flattering general order
issued, in which the Commander-in-chief stated
the following:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="author">
“<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Graham’s Town</span>,<br />
<em>22d March 1853</em>.</p>

<p>“The Commander-in-chief, in disbanding this
corps,&mdash;the Water-kloof Rangers,&mdash;wishes to
convey to its gallant commander, officers, and
men, the high estimation in which he holds
their services, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="author">
(Signed)      “<span class="smcap">A. J. Clo&euml;te</span>,<br />
<em>Quartermaster-General</em>.”<br />
</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>On my return towards England I was most
kindly greeted at Fort Beaufort with an address,
presented to me by the principal inhabitants of
the town.</p>

<p>At Graham’s Town a similar address was presented
to me by Messrs Godlington and Cocks,
members of the Legislative Council, and signed
by the principal inhabitants of the town and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the district around. I afterwards went with
these gentlemen to the sea-coast to find out
whether or not a safe roadstead for shipping
could be established somewhat nearer the town
than Port Elizabeth. Being somewhat of a military
engineer, this proved an agreeable task; and
I was already actively engaged in drawing out
plans when the news arrived of the death of a
very near relative. This closed all prospect of
banquets and receptions, or proposals for new
harbours; and I must confess that it was some
slight consolation to think that I should not
have to present myself at the head of a dinner-table
as the honoured guest, to reply to vapid
compliments.</p>

<p>At Port Elizabeth another equally gratifying
address was presented to me, and what rendered
it more pleasing was the fact of its being offered
by Mr Deare, Mr Wylde, and other gentlemen,
who had so kindly foretold my success as I
passed through their town on my way to the
front. I stayed a few days at Port Elizabeth,
and one morning I walked with some merchants
and others on its surf-beaten shore to
see how a jetty could be made to facilitate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
landing (they had heard of my plans concerning
another place), for I always had a mania for
building that follows like my shadow wherever
I go.</p>

<p>I seldom see a spot but I always, in imagination
at least, commence building upon it,&mdash;not
that I care a whit whether it is for myself or
another; yet more than one giant is living in
the House that Jack built.</p>

<p>Wherever I have passed, a road, a bridge, a
chapel,&mdash;a something, has marked my passage.
I once built a jetty in the Bay of Bourgas, betwixt
Varna and Constantinople, 147 yards long, 8
yards wide, having 22 feet of water; and on it
embarked 45,000 troops, 9400 horses, 140 field-guns,
with ample stores, for the Crimea; and
the jetty (which is still standing), and the embarkation
above mentioned, all was completed
in twelve weeks. It is true I was helped by a
British officer, Commodore Eardley Wilmot, of
her Majesty’s steamer Sphinx, but neither of
us got (nor in fact wanted) anything for our
pains. The pleasure of the work was sufficient
payment. I merely mention these things that
the reader may know that I am not a mere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
amateur soldier, but one who has had a practical
knowledge of his work.</p>

<p>As I said above, I was walking on the sea-shore
when I was accosted by a good-looking
sailor with “Sir, I am a fellow-countryman of
yours, and a west-countryman to boot. I should
like to shake hands; my name is Sam Rowe,
and I hail from Penzance.”</p>

<p>I expressed the pleasure, which I really felt,
on making his acquaintance. After this he
joined us as we proceeded in our examination
of the beach. When this was over, while we
were returning to the town, Mr Sam Rowe said
he wanted a minute’s private talk with me.
Stepping aside for that purpose, he informed me
that he would be happy to take me to Cape
Town if I would go in that nice little craft,
pointing to a cutter in the bay. He had heard
from the town-folks that I was going there, and
he thought I should like to sail with him. The
vessel was his, and his time too. It was impossible
to reply to Mr Rowe’s eager offer by
refusal, so with a shake of the hand it was
arranged there and then. The conditions were
that the vessel was to be mine during the trip;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
he and his crew, consisting of three men and a
boy (his son) were to be at my orders. Of
stores there were plenty&mdash;fish, poultry, and
salted pork, captains’ biscuits from Plymouth,
bloaters direct from Yarmouth, and real rum
from Jamaica. As for the craft herself&mdash;named
Mary Jane, after his little daughter at home&mdash;why,
nothing afloat, from a St Michael oranger
to a fifty-gun frigate, could stand with her in a
gale or a breeze. All these things Captain Sam
Rowe offered me, and in exchange only required
the company of my humble self, and yarns from
the seat of war.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards I embarked in the Mary
Jane, and found her to be a smack of forty tons.
A long time ago she had been a trawler, but was
now employed in the more important service of
a Government transport.</p>

<p>Captain Rowe I have already partly described.
I will only add that he was dark-haired, fair-skinned,
grey-eyed, about 5 feet 8 inches in
height, broad-shouldered, with well-rounded
limbs, daring to folly (but his folly had a
method in it); and his sheet-anchor a Bible, and
a stout-hearted Devonshire matron at home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>He had been in his youth first mate of an
Indiaman, afterwards captain of a fruiterer, and
now he was the commander of what had once
been his father’s craft, then called the Sea-gull,
but now rebaptised the Mary Jane. At home he
had not found trawling a very profitable business,
so with three other west-countrymen he
had started with his little craft to barter with
the natives on the West African coast.</p>

<p>How he got there was rather surprising. His
only chronometer was his father’s old watch.
He took no observations, but merely guessed at
his position from the distance run and the log.
Occasionally he took soundings&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, when he
could find them; chart he had none. Small
success had, however, attended his bold efforts,
although he had several very grand “specs” on
hand. In the hold were a lot of real Birmingham
guns, bought at 7s. 6d. apiece, which had
but one fault, that of sometimes sending off
their contents at the wrong end, hitting the
shooter instead of the object shot at. There
were also scores of magnificent crowns for
African kings, made up of tinsel paper, brass
spikes, wax pearls, and glass diamonds. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
even once, he said, furnished a mighty Ashantee
potentate with a throne. This, however, he
seemed to regret, it having been an old family
piece of furniture. Strange as this may seem,
I believed it to be quite true, as the throne in
question was merely an old arm-chair, the legs,
arms, and back of which had been severely
shaken and cracked by many a toss and tumble
in the cabin of the Mary Jane.</p>

<p>On my expressing surprise at his placing so
shaky a seat for the support of a king, he with
a sharp twinkle of the eye replied, “That is the
look-out of the occupant; and,” added he, “these
old-fashioned articles, if spliced at the proper
time and place, still last for some good length
of time.” Sam, like myself, was a stanch Conservative,
and preferred to patch his coat all
over to turning it. Not that he preferred an old
coat to a new one, but he liked the old constitutional
cut.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his grand undertakings,
Captain Sam had not succeeded as he wished,
and he thought that he had been humbugging
and humbugged enough. After struggling for
two long years through fevers on land and heavy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
surf-breakers on the shore, he had finally reached
Cape Town, from whence he was now engaged
in carrying Government stores along the coast
as far as Natal.</p>

<p>These and many similar yarns were spun in
the cabin of Sam’s little craft, in which I was
now cooped up, in an atmosphere which I found
fearfully clammy and stuffy after inhaling <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
grand air</em> for two years on African uplands.
Sam, however, did all he could to cheer the
comfortless surroundings of his small cribbed
cabin by the ever-varying novelty of his yarns.
He related many a hard-fought fight with the
storms of old ocean, to which, in spite of all, he
still clung, and with which he still hoped to have
many a tussle ere he was piped to settle his own
long account.</p>

<p>When wearying sometimes with his tales, and
the sound of the surges striking the thin wooden
sides of the trembling Mary Jane, I would go
upon deck, and there watch the long rolling
waves that sweep round the Cape, or listen to
the cheery voice of his sailor-boy, as he sang
many a ditty of Cornish and Devon heroes, and
the glorious deeds of Drake on the Spanish main.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>In this way we furrowed our way along,
making very wet weather round the coast, until
we came to the spot where the Birkenhead had
gone down so recently with all hands. Here we
luffed up for a time, and, baring our brows to the
breeze, offered a parting salute to the gallant
crew and stout-hearted red-jackets who had
here gone to their last account at duty’s call;
then, sheering off once more, filled our sails to
a half gale of wind, and bounded off like a
startled sea-gull towards Table Bay.</p>

<p>After this fashion we sped on through the sea,
throwing up ridges high above our decks, and
on the 12th July rounded the Lion’s Mountain.
Here becalmed for a time we stayed our course,
when a heavy puff from the crest of that huge
emblem of African life sent such a staggering
pressure on our outspread canvas as nearly
brought us to grief. With a sudden whirl we
were on our beam-ends! My berth on board
had never been very dry, but now I rolled into
one still more watery in the lee-scuppers. By
good luck the tackling gave way, the topsails
went overboard, and the stout craft righted
again, as Captain Sam expressed it, none the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
worse for a little deck-swabbing. I managed
also to regain my place on board, none the
worse for my startling bath.</p>

<p>The next morning I declined to land in Captain
Sam’s little punt, much to his annoyance,
as he volunteered himself to pull me ashore. I,
however, gave him to understand that it was
beneath the dignity of two such west-country
commanders as we were to land in such a tub-looking
receptacle. The fact is, after Sam had
placed his own burly person in the centre of his
boat, I saw no place except his own brawny
shoulders on which I could perch.

<p class="hang">ARRIVAL AT THE CAPE&mdash;OPINIONS ON THE WAR THERE&mdash;THE CONVERSION
OF THE HEATHEN&mdash;BAPTISM OF A RECENT CONVERT&mdash;CONVERTED
JEWS IN BUCHAREST&mdash;THE METROPOLITAN OF THE
GREEK CHURCH AND AN ENGLISH BISHOP&mdash;THE VOYAGE HOME&mdash;THE
ARETHUSA&mdash;NOZIAH VISITS CAPE TOWN TO BID ME GOOD-BYE&mdash;AFRICAN
TROPHIES&mdash;REFLECTIONS ON THE ACTUAL STATE
OF THE CAPE.</p>

<p>On landing at Cape Town, I soon found that
quite a different feeling existed regarding my
dealings with the Kaffirs from the views taken
of them in the eastern portion of the colony.</p>

<p>Here there were no burnt homesteads, despoiled
farms, or murdered occupants to bring
the horrors of war in a vivid manner before
people. Merchants, who were enriching themselves
by the money poured into the colony from
Old England, considered, no doubt, the stagnation
likely to ensue from the cessation of this
golden stream.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>Then, again, a pious class of Christians who
had been devoutly praying for the Lord’s mercy
upon all men, both for those who were cutting,
and those who were having their throats
cut, could hardly conceive how I had had the
courage to hang, as report said, Hottentot deserters.</p>

<p>Had they been Englishmen, taken red-handed
in the deed, as the Hottentots were, it might have
been right; but that I should have hung these
missionary converts, whose only conception of
brotherhood was to perform the part of Cain,
seemed beyond their understanding of what was
due to benighted niggers.</p>

<p>It is strange to remark the emulation that
exists among Christian sects in their attempts
to convert heathens to Christianity. The object
is pursued with much zeal, but with no adequate
knowledge of the work, or how it ought to be
carried on. I feel convinced that it is promoted,
like a good deal of home charity, not from any
purer motives than may be found in self or sect
ostentation. Some people who would sell their
own souls over the counter if any one would
buy them, will often give their gold freely for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
buying over to Christianity that of a nigger.
The clergy and other high dignitaries of the
Church, instead of attending to their starving
flocks at home, look “to fresh fields and pastures
new,” to try and tempt straggling black sheep
to the fold. So lately as a month ago&mdash;I write
in November 1879&mdash;a learned chief of the Protestant
faith was engaged on a long voyage of
several hundred miles to confirm a sinner. As
I was a party to the pious ceremony in question,
perhaps I may be allowed to relate how it took
place. This stray sheep, brought back to the
fold on the back of a shepherd that had once
belonged to the unbelieving community, had but
the merest notion of the language of the religion
to which he had been so happily converted. As
this innocent lamb knelt before the attentive
observers, he looked like an old bearded goat of
quite a different flock. The proceedings were
carried on in a most mysterious manner: the
bishop put the questions through the convert’s
spiritual prompter, the Rev. Mr H&mdash;&mdash;, who in
his turn gave the cue to the principal actor. But
this complicated by-play brought on a crisis;
the prompter himself got confused, and hallooed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
out loud enough for the spectators to hear, “But
who <em>was</em> your godfather?” to which query the
repentant sinner murmured “De Devil!” This
was almost too much for the bishop himself,
and several times he was evidently in doubts as
to whether or not he ought to give his spiritual
blessing to such a child of the flesh. However,
the ceremony was finally gone through, to everybody’s
satisfaction and relief.</p>

<p>In former years, conversions were carried on
far more rapidly, and on a much larger scale.
The British consulates in the East used to give a
certificate of baptism and a certificate of British
nationality at the same time, for a moderate
sum. I remember when, in the year 1854, I
was commandant of the town of Bucharest, a
deputation of Jewish converts to Christianity
waited upon me for help. They complained
that their pastor, the Rev. Mr M&mdash;&mdash;s, had
abandoned his sheep at home, and gone to sell
sheepskin jackets to the British army in the
Crimea. These poor forlorn wanderers added,
that if I could not help them with pecuniary
assistance, they would strike and knock off work
as Christians, returning to their old faith. On
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
considering the price asked, and the value of
what was proffered, I advised them strongly to
do as they said, not feeling justified in spending
a shilling upon them.</p>

<p>The East is a difficult labyrinth for a man to
find his way through, there are so many finger-posts
having political meanings, so many cross-paths
of various denominations leading to heaven
knows where!&mdash;lovely by-lanes, with all the delights
of the world on their flowery banks, that
men, bewildered and in despair, put up too often
at the half-way houses on the road, making
themselves as happy as they can with all the
worldly joys around them; it is often the devil
to pay&mdash;but, alas! many thousand freethinkers
do not hesitate to do it. The only result of such
a competition for converts is to separate men
more widely than ever. This is not my opinion
alone. I had, in the presence of the English
bishop above mentioned, a conversation with
the Metropolitan of the Greek Church of the
East. I was alluding, in the name of the Protestant
divine, to the regret experienced as to
the divisions existing in the Church of our
Lord. The exact words of the Metropolitan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
and which I am authorised to state, were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell his eminence of the Anglican Church
that it is not the flock of Christ which is so
wayward; it is we shepherds who drive them
about in different directions for our own profit.
What would become of me, Metropolitan of a
Greek Church, if his eminence could convert
them to Protestantism? What would become
of him if I could convert his sheep to orthodoxy?
And it is so with all Churches: they, the congregations,
could be brought easily to assemble and
be thankful to God in one mode of faith, but it
cannot take place because we shepherds have an
interest in dividing them.”</p>

<p>This fearless expounder of the truth afterwards
added, in reply to the bishop’s desire
that a prayer should be offered up by the clergy
for the union of the Christian Churches in one:
“God would not listen to our prayers: our
kingdom, the kingdom of the priests, has been
in all times a worldly kingdom; that to come
will, I believe, belong to the poor. If these latter
were to ask, God would listen to them, but not
to us who cannot sincerely pray for such an end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
that would be the destruction of priestly power.
“I will,” he added, “give you an instance of
the intricacies of the question. I who hold in
my own hand some of the threads, cannot surmise
a real clue to the solution, but would, as
a curiosity, like to explain what I know of
them.”</p>

<p>“On a late visit to Paris I went in full canonical
dress, and assisted at High Mass in Notre
Dame. The ceremony was a grand one; the
Cardinal Archbishop of Paris himself officiated.
I knew but little of the rites and ceremonies
he went through, but when he bowed or knelt
I did the same. When he prayed, I joined in
the prayer; when he blessed, I bowed my head
and asked inwardly his blessing. I felt the devotion
of all around, and I joined my gratitude
to the Giver of all mercies.</p>

<p>“The ceremony over, I went to the usual
room behind the altar for disrobing, and was
disrobed by canonical officials, as though I had
been one of the chiefs in the Church. I believe,
from what I have heard since, that no one was
offended by the manner in which I assumed a
somewhat prominent part.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>“The next day I went in my official robes
as a Metropolitan of the Eastern Church, and
attended by the acolytes usual on official occasions,
to pay a visit to the Cardinal Archbishop
himself. <em>He would not receive me.</em> No doubt
orders had been sent from elsewhere forbidding
an official recognition of my position in
a Church at all events equal in antiquity to
his own.</p>

<p>“You see what divisions sever the leaders;
how then can we expect the flock to follow them
into one fold? No, no; we priests divide in
order to reign. Unity of the Church can only
be obtained by people going to Christ without
waiting for us. None of us can define, with
convincing simplicity to the masses, what authority
we really possess as delegates of our
Saviour. I for my part am willing to hold out
the hand of fellowship to all men, even to those
erring brethren the Jews. In a few days I shall
pronounce in the Senate a speech in favour of
their admission into this country as citizens.
I must confess that in this I have listened more
to the voice of Christianity in the West than in
this part of the world. It is difficult for us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Roumanians to look upon the Jew as a brother
who looks upon our Saviour as an impostor.
Yet still I have persuaded myself to perform
this ill-defined task. I only trust in God that
the passing of the measure will not tend to increase
free-thinking doubt. I would even open
my seminaries to the Jews, so much do I long
to see all men brethren, but they would not
come to them; neither do I regret it, for the
orthodox Church ought, I think, to remain in
the present what she has been in the past&mdash;a
prudent, wise, and charitable mother, seeking to
govern her own children wisely, leaving other
Churches to do the same with theirs.</p>

<p>“I shall go to England next year if my
health allow; and although I shall try and
convert no one, I hope there will be no necessity
for conversion to convince English prelates that
they have in me a true Christian brother.”</p>

<p>The English prelate was a kind-hearted,
learned man, full to overflowing with a wish to
do good, but evidently puzzled how to set about
it. There is a patriarchal vigour about some of
the older forms of belief, which, in its racy
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomie</em>, dwarfs Anglicanism considerably, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
makes it look somewhat of a sect&mdash;true, a good
one, as, from the power and influence at its disposal,
it would be strange if it were not; yet
in a contrast like the above, it must be confessed
that it has, outwardly at least, a rather
“Brummagem” look. The Protestantism of
Germany, in spite of its dreary aspirations, has
a much broader basis. It encourages an untrammelled
intercourse between thinkers of all
denominations. There is an ebb and flow of
ideas going on between it and the older forms
of religion in the East which merit the attention
of all who follow the outward growth and
forms of Christianity. I have attended a Protestant
service in the East where more than half
of a large congregation were members of the
Greek Church; and of the many members of
that community with whom I have come into
contact, and with whom I have spoken on the
subject of religion, none seemed to dislike, and
many seemed to like, the Saxon form of Protestantism
as it exists in Transylvania; and I must
testify that a better class of men than there
produced under this form of religion it would
be difficult to find anywhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>To return from this long digression to my
position at Cape Town. My execution of some
Hottentot deserters had made me some pious
enemies there. Of this I was quite indifferent.
The Commander-in-chief, who saw one of them
strung up to a tree, displayed his approval of
the proceeding. I intimated, however, to those
who were kindly bestirring themselves to get up
an address to me from the inhabitants of Cape
Town to leave the matter alone. I had been
perfectly satisfied with the recognition of those
living near the seat of war, who had had opportunities
of seeing the work I had to do, and the
way in which I did it.</p>

<p>I now prepared for my return to England. I
had several proposals, amongst others, from my
friend Captain Sam Rowe, who placed himself
and his stout little smack at my disposal. I
hardly liked the idea of being cooped up again
in so small a space for so long a voyage, although
I was strongly tempted by the thought
of visiting the whole western coast of Africa, as
Captain Rowe proposed we should do. I even
entertained, for a time, the idea of traversing
the whole continent&mdash;at all events, of proceeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
up the Zambesi, and from thence on to
Zanzibar. But the supposed hostility of the
Portuguese authorities to the last-named trip,
which was somewhat confirmed by the conversations
I had with the Portuguese Consul at Cape
Town, prevented me. The trip across the continent
was also put off by the refusal of the Hon.
R. C&mdash;&mdash;, who did not wish to go to such length
on a shooting expedition (the only object <em>he</em> had
in view); while I, more ambitiously inclined,
had not the means to make alone so lengthened
a journey as a trip across the dark continent
would have been.</p>

<p>After many hesitations, the fortunate arrival
of some brother officers from the seat of war
decided the question. We engaged for ourselves
a schooner-yacht called the Arethusa, belonging
to a Mr Eade, a London merchant: the only
part of the vessel not at our disposal was the
necessary space for a sufficient cargo as ballast.
Everything being ready for our departure, we
were seated in the boat that was to convey us
to the tight little ship that had already let go
her hold of African ground, and was tacking
about in the bay, bending her white wings to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the breeze, seemingly as eager as ourselves to
wend her way to our island-home. There were
many kind adieus waved to us from the shore,
which the Arethusa acknowledged by a parting
salute from her small miniature guns. Loud
cheers, hurrahs, sham demonstrations&mdash;the more
boisterous the better, to conceal real parting regret&mdash;when,
above all the din, one clear shrill
voice pierced my ear as an arrow. “Come
back! come back!” it cried. I looked behind,
and there, on the pier, stood Noziah beckoning
me to return to the shore. How could I?
What could I say to her? Never by word or
deed had I wronged her. Often when she
looked in a mirror had she told me that she
wished herself dead because her skin was not
white like mine. Her simple faith, however,
shamed mine. When I told her that “God
made us all equal,” her colour ever rose like
a sable shroud between her life and mine. If
ever the dream of making all races one is to be
realised, God must do it; man never can. So
the boat went on its way, and I left that dusky
form standing on the narrow pier like a statue
of clay.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>When the war had come to an end, I had obtained,
through the kindness of General Cathcart,
an order for a commissariat transport to
take Noziah to her brother Sandilli. This conveyance
was afterwards sold off and purchased
by her. In this she had come to Cape Town.
My agent, Mr H&mdash;&mdash;, upon whom she called the
next day as she was leaving the town, wrote
and informed me that she had gone back to her
home. This was the last I heard of that pure-hearted,
innocent African maid.</p>

<p>Once on board I had plenty of interesting
matters to think about. I had brought down
from the front several wild animals and birds,
which I intended for the Zoological Gardens at
home. Amongst others, a springbok, which
Mr Mitchell, then director of the Gardens in
Regents Park, informed me was the first of
that species of antelope that had been seen
alive in England.</p>

<p>I also had several birds equally rare, and
monkeys, besides sacks of roots, bulbs, and
herbs, the spoils of African glades, with which
I intended to adorn my own little garden at
home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>When all things had been safely stowed
away, and night was drawing on, I went to
the taffrail, and looking over, thought of the
land now sinking in the distance. It is a
glorious spot that Cape, which Vasco de Gama
called of Good Hope, while he thought of the
wonders it contained, as yet unseen by the
white man. And so it is still to all those who
seek a future for our race: that mighty continent
which Grant has lately strode over, and
Livingstone claimed for us by there laying
down his life. The entire continent must, in
my opinion, be yet spread open to us through
the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>When I proposed to the Hon. R. C&mdash;&mdash; the
noble task of pioneering the way, I felt that
we then stood at the real starting-point. It is
useless to seek a passage by wading through
the oceans of sandy deserts in effete Northern
Africa, when the explorer may recruit his
strength, and start almost every day with renewed
life, from the fertile unexhausted Cape.</p>

<p>Of settled life there is already a strong and
valuable nucleus. Both Dutch and English
present as fine specimens of our common Protestantism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and are as enthusiastic lovers of constitutional
rights, as are to be found anywhere.
The fault hitherto impeding their useful amalgamation
has been the forcing process employed
by the Home Government.</p>

<p>The annexation of the Transvaal has been a
most immature and ill-devised proceeding. However
good the wished-for object may be in itself,
the end can never justify violence; and the
ten thousand Dutch Boers, born and bred with
the same prevalent ideas as existed during the
Puritan times at home, cannot, by a stroke of
the pen, be brought into allegiance to the British
Crown. The native population are slowly
disappearing, like dark clouds at sunrise. The
advent of the white man dispels all visions of
the land ever returning to the blindness and
horrors of a barbarian sway. Let those who
dream of admixture of races look to the difficulties
at home, and hold their peace.

<p>We had a fine passage as far as St Helena.
The Arethusa was a fast sailer and a good sea
boat, although rather crank at times under the
press of canvas we sometimes induced our good-natured
Captain B&mdash;&mdash; to clap on her lofty
spars; in fact she was overmasted, and required
all that nice attention as to trimming that a
top-heavy belle of the seas must have not to
show too much of her keel.</p>

<p>From St Helena we sailed towards Ascension,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
noted for its turtle. The island itself is a dull,
brown spot lying in the sea, its cracked surface
looking like a burnt egg-shell. This place was
discovered by Jan de Noves, a Portuguese
navigator, on Ascension Day, 1501&mdash;hence its
name&mdash;at least so I was told by a whitey-brown
native who boarded us.</p>

<p>We had now arrived somewhat near the
“horse” latitudes, and in calm weather, and with
no work to kill the time, we began some horseplay
with the monkeys on board. The name
given to these latitudes arose from the number
of horses the Spaniards used to throw overboard
when becalmed&mdash;sometimes for weeks&mdash;in these
regions, passing to and fro between their South
American possessions and Europe. The chief
object of our fun on board was a large, greenish,
long-tailed monkey, who, with Darwinian forethought,
had pitched upon young C&mdash;&mdash; as the
fittest selection Providence had placed within
his reach on the high seas. The competition
as to natural fitness was so close between the
two, that it was often a cause of serious dispute
as to which should have his way.</p>

<p>One day, after a sharp bout of this kind, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
real quarrel ensued, as will occur sometimes in
the best-regulated families; and young C&mdash;&mdash;,
who prided himself much on ancestral descent,
as, no doubt, did also his still more anciently
descended rival, came to a regular stand-up
fight with the monkey. Strength was on the
side of C&mdash;&mdash;, whilst cunning and skill were on
the side of the old un; but at last the upstart
gave his ancient <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confr&egrave;re</em> such a tremendous
upper cut, as he was holding on to the ratlines,
near the bulwark, that he was knocked
out of time into the bosom of the impenetrable
deep, and poor young Ben (that was the name
of our monkey) had to swim for it.</p>

<p>As this typical representative of lost nationality
and universal brotherhood breasted the
waves like a corker, we tried to lower a boat;
but although the apparatus always acts at home,
it never does at sea, so the boat stuck up in the
air on its davits. We then threw a life-belt
towards the now nearly exhausted Ben; but
although he had enough instinct to grasp it, he
had not enough sense to pass it over his head
and under his arms. So we saw his efforts getting
slowly weaker and weaker as he clasped and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
clutched at the slippery buoy, and at length he
sank beneath the waves, down, down among
the dead men, to be found again, no doubt, one
day by some yet undreamt-of ethno-geologist,
who will perhaps deduce from his bones that the
aborigines of the Atlantic were very little men,
with long caudal appendages, and descant learnedly
upon every link in that long tail, until he
comes to the end of his own, and finds out his
mistake.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this sad event we proposed
a sort of Irish wake, to be held as we
passed the line.</p>

<p>From Ascension we reached away so far to
the west that nothing but the most abstract
calculation could give our captain any idea
as to the latitude and longitude in which we
really were, and our little bark seemed to be
dancing about on the line like an amateur
rope-dancer. This is a rather metaphysical
metaphor; but I am talking learnedly now, influenced,
no doubt, by our skipper’s tuition.
Time hanging heavily on my hands in this dead
calm, when even the green waves assumed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
lifeless heaviness of molten lead, I had taught
myself navigation, and held such lengthy discussions
with our captain as to the position and
value of stars, planets, and constellations, as
to appear to the somewhat astonished listeners
around as though I were a Newton and a Pascal
rolled into one.</p>

<p>The captain and I, over our glasses (telescopes
I mean, of course), had become so awfully
knowing, that my only doubts were as to which
knew the least of the two; and it was only for
the sake of the respect due to seniority in this
happy ignorance that I allowed him to navigate
the ship. One day, however, nettled by some
critical observations of mine, in a sudden fit
of displeasure he threw up his commission as
skipper, and I took his place; but as it happened
to be a dead calm at the time, I had
no means of showing my superior seamanship.
Thus time passed on, while I still retained a
certain happy-go-lucky faith in my own <em>star</em>
quite as strong as the captain’s in his. In this
I was fully justified, as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>On passing over the supposed line, which our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
captain, after dinner, had kindly chalked out
before us in a very zigzag manner on the mahogany,
in the prelude to the <em>in memoriam</em>
wake for poor Ben, whom, as I previously
stated, we had left deep down in the phosphorescent
waters of the southern hemisphere.
While others were singing song after song in
happy oblivion of past warfare at the Cape, <em>I</em>
was thinking that we had entered into British
waters. This was somewhat a stretch of imagination,
but nothing is too big for me when I
dream of Old England&mdash;like Ben, I dive into
futurity. Thus human nature seeks for pleasure
and enjoyment in many and varied channels,
according to its own appreciation of wherein
these consist.</p>

<p>The bottle was circling freely, and the hot,
stifling atmosphere of the mess-cabin below made
us feel delightfully dry every time it neared
us, as one after another we passed the Rubicon
between self-possession and being possessed.
Notwithstanding all this joviality, an uncomfortable
feeling was slowly creeping over me,
and at last became so unbearable that I ran
upon deck to breathe the fresh air. How grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
all appeared under that mighty dome, compared
to the rafters of the cabin below! The
night was glorious in its starry splendour;
the sea slept gently heaving, as though with
loving dreams surging, while soft breezes rippled
its face with smiles.</p>

<p>The boisterous mirth arising from the cabin
below seemed strangely out of place. I turned
to the man at the helm; the idiot seemed as
screwed as the wheel that rolled in his slackened
grasp. “Holloa, mate!” I said, “what
is that light on the water you are steering
for?” pointing to a flame I saw gleaming there.
“A tar-barrel,” he said, “some chaps passing
the line have chucked overboard.” “But it is
nearing us too fast for that&mdash;look out, man!
Good God! its a ship!&mdash;luff, luff!” and suiting
the action to the word, I jumped to the wheel
and jammed the helm down; then swiftly glided
by a huge black hull, its deck crowded with
dusky figures, shouting and gesticulating to us
like demons, its stern grazing our quarter, as the
good ship Arethusa, like a form endowed with
life, sprang up into the wind, and saved herself
from destruction. One second more and we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
had been down, down amongst the dead men,
not far from poor Ben.</p>

<p>Up rushed the startled convivialists from
below, some with their glasses still in hand, and
I crept ’neath the bulwarks, and kneeling, felt a
mother’s prayer had been heard that night on
my behalf. This vessel proved to be the Mauritius,
a large iron screw, then bound on her first
voyage to India round the Cape. She was
afterwards one of the fleet of transports placed
under my orders for the conveyance of troops to
the Crimea, an account of which will shortly
appear in my military correspondence concerning
that war. This narrow squeak sobered us
for a few days, but our spirits revived as the
western winds now began to blow.</p>

<p>The frigate-hawk&mdash;a truly wonderful bird for
its powers of flight&mdash;came often to pay us a visit,
and changed the monotony of continually looking
into the sea for beings endowed with life.
I might have shot one or two, and had the head
of my rifle more than once on their bodies, as
they floated overhead without a quiver in their
outspread wings; but such aerial life I did not
like to see streaked with blood, so I left them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
alone in their boundless home, instead of sending
them to a glass cage in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Of shark, bonito, and other scaly-looking denizens
of the sea, there had been often exciting
scenes of what some called sport, but I must say
I never could see much fun in it. I certainly
should have liked to have had a go-in with a
vicious-looking shark on fair terms, but then I
was most undeniably afraid of him in the water,
and on the deck of our ship he was no match
for me; so, before I had seen two such hooked
monsters hauled on board and butchered with
spears and knives, I used to feel rather disgusted
than otherwise with such displays.</p>

<p>As for the huge, gaunt-looking albatross as
they flapped their leather-looking wings like
vampires around us, no one seemed particularly
anxious to settle accounts with them: a superstitious
awe influenced even the most reckless
amongst us as they circled above our heads.
Curiously enough, the only one who had the
courage to pull a trigger at them was young
K&mdash;&mdash; of the 74th, and he died soon after he
landed.</p>

<p>We were now in latitudes where westerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
gales are of frequent occurrence, and a rattling
one caught us one night as we were running
with studding-sails set. So sudden was its
approach that there could be no question of our
taking in sail; so, in a storm of wind and rain,
we flew along as though Neptune on his foaming
sea-horses was trying to catch us. The poor
little Arethusa fairly staggered under the force
of the gale, like a startled hare now swerving to
the right, now to the left, twisting, cracking,
and burying herself in the sea as deep as she
could without absolutely giving up the struggle
and going once for all to the bottom, until old
blustering Boreas at last, in kind compassion,
relieved us of some spars. Then, with the rags
of our late flaunting sails, and with just as much
more as was necessary to steady us on our course,
we proceeded more safely if more humbly than
before. The little ship rose buoyant to the seas
as though no longer afraid of them, starting
afresh from the top and sliding down the ribbed
backs of the long-rolling billows, defying them
as they crested their foaming heads in anger
behind us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>It was very exciting. I thought of Sam
Rowe and his little smack battling with such
weather, and though I had more confidence in
his skill than in that of our skipper, yet, like
Tom Bowling, I preferred the Arethusa in the
Bay of Biscay to the Mary Jane.</p>

<p>Good old Sam! I hope he won’t think me
foolish as he reads these lines&mdash;for the old boy
is hale and hearty yet, and, with spectacles on
nose, and ‘Western Times’ in hand, can still
discuss matters shrewdly.</p>

<p>On the 30th July the white cliffs of Brighton
gladdened our eyes, and running up the coast,
we hove to off Eastbourne and took a pilot
on board. Some of us were so anxious to get
ashore that we took passage in the boat that
had brought out the pilot, and with a cheer
from some of the more patient who had remained
on deck, pulled away to the beach; but on our
arrival there, we found that the boat was too deep
in the water to get close in to the shore. This
did not stop us. Young L&mdash;&mdash; and I jumped
into the surf up to our waists and waded ashore.
This ducking had in no wise cooled my excitement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
for, in placing my foot once more on
English soil, I threw myself on the ground and
gave it a hearty kiss.</p>

<p>After this exhibition I felt rather taken aback
by the astonished looks of some sight-seers who
had come down to view our disembarkation.
On rising to explain matters to the astonished
natives I could not get a word out. They no
doubt thought me to be choking with emotion,
but it was otherwise. In the fervour of my
embrace the sand had got into my mouth, and,
as I had no tooth-brush at hand, I was obliged
to make use of my finger to remove a lump of
my fatherland from my mouth, as though it had
been a quid.</p>

<p>Young L&mdash;&mdash;, who jumped with me from the
boat, had also gone through the same kissing
ceremony; he, however, had not taken such a
greedy mouthful, and after carefully wiping the
salt water from his boots and trousers with his
handkerchief, kindly offered to perform the same
operation for me. To this I consented; but I
thought he was paying rather too much solicitude
to my appearance as he scrubbed away at
my face; however, the task once over, we started
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
for the Parade, to the laughing astonishment of
all the bystanders. After proceeding a little
distance L&mdash;&mdash; left me on some frivolous pretext,
and I went on alone.</p>

<p>On reaching the Parade, among the first persons
I met were Lady P&mdash;&mdash; and her daughters&mdash;intimate
friends of my family. Without much
hesitation I gave the old lady a kiss, and would
have continued the salute all round if allowed,
had not the expression, or rather impression,
on her ladyship’s face made me hesitate. She
had a marbled forehead, a black-spotted nose,
and a comically shaped O round her lips. I saw
that I must have blackened her face; and as I
knew that it could not have been done by any
African black imported from the Kaffirs, I recollected
that it must have been by some of
Day &amp; Martin’s received from L&mdash;&mdash;’s pocket-handkerchief
as we made our hurried toilet on
the beach. Lady P&mdash;&mdash; kindly accepted my
excuses for this uncalled-for display of polished
attention, and after a few words of explanation,
left me spotless of any design to darken either
her face or her fame.</p>

<p>On arriving in London I continued busy for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
some days in forwarding my importations, bulbs,
and plants to my home, at that time at Grangewood,
Leicester; and the springbok, monkeys,
&amp;c., to the “Zoo” in Regent’s Park.</p>

<p>My first serious business after my arrival was
to bring the disgraceful condition of the great
Napoleon’s last residence to the attention of her
Majesty’s Government. Every time my thoughts
travelled back to my late undertakings in South
Africa they passed over St Helena, and recoiled
with shame at the desolate state into which
England had allowed this place to fall. I, however,
had not a voice loud enough to be heard
at the time, and notwithstanding my repeated
efforts in that direction, I could not get a member
of the Government during the Gladstonian
era to take the matter up. It was only in 1855
that I at last obtained a hearing. Lord Clarendon,
to whom I sent a copy of my suggestions
as to what England ought to do, wrote me to
say that I should no doubt be glad to hear
that her Majesty’s Government had taken the
necessary measures to place the tomb, residence,
&amp;c., under the safeguard of the French Government.
He did not, however, mention a word of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
recognition as to its having been done at my
suggestion; in fact, on re-reading his letter to-day,
it seems to imply that <em>he</em> was the author of
the whole affair, and <em>I</em> merely a busy-body in
the matter.</p>

<p>My correspondence during the conferences
held for the signing of the Treaty of Paris will
explain many curious, and I may say interesting,
details as to this Treaty still undreamt of
by the public.</p>

<p>I now turned my attention to the attainment
of my long-hoped-for position in the British
army; and in this the Duke of Newcastle, then
Colonial Minister&mdash;who had always taken a
warm interest in my welfare, as he did in that
of many others&mdash;promised to support me to the
utmost of his power, in accordance with the
deserts of my actual services, and the loud
recognition the colonists themselves in their addresses
to me had vouchsafed to give. Days
and weeks went by without any progress being
made in the matter, and I passed my time in
travelling between London and Tamworth. Now
and then, indeed, I attended a public dinner, at
which I made short, confused speeches&mdash;for I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
really never could understand what I had done
worth being thanked for; and I only hoped to
be enabled, from my past efforts and position
acquired, to do something more.</p>

<p>This opportunity, however, the Horse Guards
authorities seemed determined not to give me.
One day I received a letter from the Colonial
Secretary, saying I had better come up to town
and place the matter myself before the proper
authorities. This was an intense bore to me.
If I had rendered any real service it was patent
enough to explain itself, but I had an excessive
dislike to perform the part of oculist to those
who were wilfully blind. However, I submitted
so far as to write the usual letter asking
for an audience of the Military Secretary. The
reply came in due time, and I presented myself
at the Horse Guards on the day stated for
reception.</p>

<p>My number was twelve; and when it was
called out I went to the door leading to the
audience-room, and was in the act of entering,
when a tall, lanky fellow, coming up quickly
from behind, pushed me aside, and thrust himself
before me into the room. I was in no good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
humour at the time, and I have no doubt looked
bent on resenting this impertinent act; but before
I could reach out my hand to turn this young
fellow round and ask for an explanation, Colonel
Airey stepped up between us, and said, “Captain
Lakeman, let me beg of you to wait for a
few minutes outside, for I have some words of
importance to communicate to this gentleman.”</p>

<p>I felt but little inclined to accede to this wish,
and explained that I had as yet no apology for
what had taken place. He said he would give
me that himself, and again begged me kindly to
wait outside.</p>

<p>To this, after some demur, I consented, for I
could not readily conceive what prevented the
young man in question from giving an excuse
for his rudeness, assuming that he had one
to offer; so I said, as he was looking from the
Colonel to me, open-mouthed, without saying
a word, “If this gentleman is a foreigner, and
cannot speak English, let the matter rest for the
moment,” and thereupon I left the room. I
stayed, kicking my heels for some time outside,
strongly tempted to leave, for I felt instinctively
nothing good was likely to result from the proposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
interview; but I thought of the kind-hearted
Duke, and to oblige him I remained.</p>

<p>At length my number was called again, and
upon entering, the Colonel was most off-handed
in his communications. “You see, Captain
Lakeman,” he said, “the times are looking dark
in the East, as you no doubt are aware, and
coming events cast their shadows before: much
anxiety is felt at the Horse Guards. I have
some doubts myself as to whether I shall not
throw down the pen and take up the sword.
You see blood will tell, and that young gentleman,
who I must say behaved rather abruptly
towards you, came also to offer his services at
this critical time.” I said, “May I ask you,
Colonel, the name of that young man?” “Oh
dear me, yes!” he said; “it was Viscount Forth.
You see, Captain Lakeman,” he added, “that in
times such as these we want the back-bone of
the nation, the English aristocracy, to come to
the front.” (By a curious coincidence this <em>back-bone</em>
of the nation did come to the front in the
Crimea, in the very first engagement he was in,
for he showed it instead of his chest to the
Russians as he bolted to Balaklava.) “And I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
have just presented to him a commission. Now
please let me know, Captain Lakeman, what I
can do for you.”</p>

<p>I was turning over in my mind what answer
to give to this polite inquiry, when this usually
taciturn military secretary, in seemingly overflowing
spirits, burst out again, with a wave of
the hand&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, it is needless to ask; his Grace has
kindly spoken in your behalf, but really I am
sorry to say that we have bestowed so many
commissions of late, that I think, after all, as
you are rich, you had better purchase, and I will
do all I can to remove any impediments in the
way as to age, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>I was then twenty-four. This very kind proposal
had such a supremely ridiculous effect on
me, that notwithstanding all my efforts to contain
myself before so dignified a person as the
Military Secretary, I could not help laughing
audibly. It did not even occur to me that I
ought to make any attempt to conceal my
amusement at this ridiculous proposal, so, bowing
lowly, I rose and left the room, leaving the
somewhat astonished Colonel alone in his doubts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
as to whether, after all, Viscount Forth or myself
had the best claims to a commission in her
Majesty’s service.</p>

<p>This was the discouraging result of a military
education, finished at the best Continental
schools, with the further advantage of having
accompanied European armies in the field for the
sake of instruction; of having placed the modern
rifle, at my own expense, in the hands of the
British soldier; of showing the use of better
accoutrements (my men wore the helmet in
1851); of having been mentioned many times
in general orders for gallant conduct in the field,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Well, I thought, the sooner this state
of affairs is changed the sooner Old England will
find better servants.</p>

<p>In this mood I went to report progress in
Downing Street. His Grace of Newcastle was
kind and considerate as usual, and abused the
Horse Guards as heartily as the British Radical,
and finally left me to consult with Mr R&mdash;&mdash;,
his private secretary, as to what now remained
to be done to meet the views of the colonists
concerning a recognition of my services to
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>In the present state of affairs nothing suitable
seemed to present itself; a civil employment
abroad&mdash;the only gift at the disposal of the
Colonial Office&mdash;did not meet my views; so,
after a lengthened confab, I returned to my
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">lares</em> and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">penates</em>, and awaited events.

WITH PREDECESSORS IN ARMOUR&mdash;THE CEREMONY&mdash;CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>Events came rapidly enough. Those shadows
in the East at which Colonel Airey had been
throwing his pen, and was now preparing his
sword to demolish, were thickening fast. A
mission was offered to me to go to Constantinople,
which I eagerly accepted, and in September
1853 I left England for the East. On my
arrival there I was sent by Lord Stratford de
Redcliffe to Gallipoli. I made a lengthy report
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
to show the uselessness of that spit of land as a
place of rendezvous for the English and French
to fight the Russians, then hundreds of miles
away across the Balkans and the Danube.</p>

<p>Gallipoli is a point that may be used to
threaten Asia, but not Europe. As such it was
used by the Galli or Gauls&mdash;hence its name. I
exposed the fact that an army disembarking for
the purpose of repelling an invader, which the
Russian army was, lost all the prestige of success
by preparing defences in case of retreat,
and the fortifying of Gallipoli meant nothing
else. It seemed almost cowardly thus to begin
when the Turks alone were meeting the Russians
in the open field. After Lord Stratford
had received this report, he sent me further
directions to visit the whole length of the Dardanelles
and investigate the military and political
influence they would possess in the East, supposing
a war took place between England and
Russia. These instructions I followed out, and
afterwards returned to Constantinople along the
shores of the Sea of Marmora, giving further
details concerning the entire coast. His lordship
was so satisfied with the manner in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
I had performed my task that he gave me immediately
another to perform. I was sent on
board H.M.S. the Valorous, Captain Loring, with
a dragoman of the Embassy (Mr Sarel), to
Varna, from whence I was to visit all the fortresses
on the Danube, to report on their actual
state and future importance, and to furnish a
description of the Turkish army then in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>On landing at Varna, I found that a report
on that place would be useless, as Colonel Neale,
then her Majesty’s Consul there, was putting
the last touch to a most able account of its
importance and real value. The Colonel had
seen fighting whilst employed in the Spanish
Legion under brave General Evans, and was as
competent in wielding the pen as the sword.</p>

<p>From Varna we proceeded to Schumla, and a
bitterly cold trip it was. I must here explain
that I had left Constantinople in an evening
costume in the following manner: At a soiree
held at the Embassy at which I had the honour
to assist, Lord Stratford, to whom that same day
I had given in my report concerning the Dardanelles,
came from his study into the room and
said he wanted me to make a similar report on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the Danube, and that I must start directly.
He had just spoken to Captain Loring of the
Valorous on the subject, who had already left
the Embassy for his vessel. Steam was already
up, and the sooner I left the better.</p>

<p>As for clothes, I might have anything in his
own wardrobe. Without more ado I took a
greatcoat belonging to his lordship, which I
still possess as a reminiscence of one of the
greatest men England ever sent to represent her.</p>

<p>Thus accoutred I went on board, Mr Sarel
following much in the same style of attire.
When on board, Captain Loring kindly offered
any part of his outfit for my use, but no number
of reefs would bring them to a suitable shape on
my then slender form; and Colonel Neale’s short
hose were so stumpy and baggy as to make me
look like a Blue-coat boy under the trailing
garment of Lord Stratford: so I declined all
these proffered masqueradings, and got on my
Tartar post-boy charger on my way to Schumla,
bundled up in such rolls of hay round my legs
and arms as to make my little nag more inclined
to eat than to carry me. Poor Sarel was in a
still worse plight than myself. I at all events
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
had been well hardened in the saddle, while he
had only been accustomed to the soft chairs at
the Embassy, and soon sat on the leather of his
seat as though it had been the pigskin of the
tenderest sucking-pig in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Thus we proceeded in a rather undignified
fashion up the Deona Valley, through Peveda
and Batschesci to Schumla. There I saw Omar
Pasha, and after two or three interviews,
cemented an intimacy with him that the
efforts of none could afterwards break until he
left this world.</p>

<p>Omar had all the talents in him of which
great men are made, but he had also the dominant
failing of the weakest&mdash;namely, that of an
unbeliever. It was at Schumla that I had the
first opportunity of seeing the sterling worth and
the vices of the Turkish army, of which Omar
was so fitting a commander and representative
chief. Here I saw men who lately, panic-stricken,
had run away from a few harmless
Russian scouts <em>on the other side of the Danube</em>,
now patiently dragging, with frost-bitten feet
and hands, big siege-guns on sledges through
snow as a mere matter of ordinary duty. Tall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
sturdy, smiling countenances, with death’s cold
hand already upon them. But I shall not
enlarge on these scenes for the present.</p>

<p>I visited Schumla in question, and returned
in the good ship Valorous to Constantinople.
This city, which an Englishman gave his name
to (for Constantine the Great was not only
British-born, but his mother, the great St Helena,
was the daughter of a remarkable king of Essex),
was to me a place of wonder: my eyes were
more occupied in feasting on its marvels, than
my thoughts in working out its future.</p>

<p>The men of the Embassy were as remarkable
as their chief&mdash;the Smythes, the Allisons, the
Brodies, and the Pisanis, were a bright nucleus
of men any nation might be proud of. Neither
were the representatives of the real antagonists,
Russia and France, much below them&mdash;the
Aussicks, the Menschikoffs, were no ordinary
men.</p>

<p>My mission being ended I returned to England,
and on arrival found that my report had created
more anxiety than satisfaction.</p>

<p>Whatever the world may say or think about
those then actually in power, I found them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
be possessed of only erroneous preconceptions
and to be influenced by indecision. As I unfolded
to Lord Raglan the real state of affairs,
he kept nervously twitching the stump of his
arm, and looked more like a victim going to be
sacrificed on the altar of duty, than a general
prepared to take the command of an army.</p>

<p>I was thanked for what I had done, but that
was all I got for my pains. True, Colonel Airey
called me always Captain; but as this was a mere
act of courtesy, just as two years afterwards he
called me General when in the Crimea, I naturally
placed no more value on it than it deserved.
I hope, however, that he will read my future
description of that campaign, and explain by
what misconception he needlessly caused so
many thousands of British soldiers to go through
such an amount of bitter suffering.</p>

<p>At this time I was offered a knighthood, but
refused it as being of no military value to me.
Another mission was then proposed, which I
accepted. Russia and France seemed determined
to seize each other by the throat, in their
dispute as to which of them had the right to
paint the Holy Sepulchre, and to hold the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
keys of that tomb which the apostles found
empty.</p>

<p>Lord Stratford was looking on as arbitrator.
His better judgment was with Russia, but his
bias against her; his grand intellect swayed to
and fro in his efforts to reconcile both. Some
of his despatches at this momentous time are
the grandest specimens of diplomatic correspondence
to be found in the English language.
To those who were cognisant of the tortuous
intricacies of the Eastern question, the truth,
the energy, the flashes of genius amidst obscure
renderings that are therein found, are something
truly wonderful. Had he willed it, at this time,
the war would not have taken place; but his
great mind at last wearied, and reeled under
the burden of holding the balance aloof in such
weighty matters; and from being judge he became
advocate, thinking, perhaps, that the shells
might remain to Russia and France, whilst England
should have the oyster. This could not be
right, for the British Government had no perception
of the duty that was incumbent on possession.
Its actions reminded me of what I
had then recently witnessed in the Turkish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
provinces. There beys or governors were good
enough in themselves, and to those of the same
creed, but they lived and haughtily prospered
on the vices and failings of those whom they
governed.</p>

<p>Parents often kept their children, or children
their parents, in prison, to satisfy any pique of
the moment, or persistent desire to wrong one
another. At Silivri, ancient Silymbria, a town
of Roumelia, on the Sea of Marmora, containing
about 8000 inhabitants, I turned out of prison
upwards of sixty persons, who had been kept in
durance vile by the governor on the daily payment
of so much per head, according to the rank
of the incarcerated, for no crime whatever, but
simply to satisfy the grudge of persons with
whom they were at enmity. A Nicolai Bogdan,
a wealthy tradesman of the town, had imprisoned
his own mother to gratify the spite of his wife
for some supposed family wrongs; and as the
poor old woman left the prison, where she had
been confined for the last four years, squalid in
her filth and rags, Ahmed Bey, the governor,
asked me if such a dog of a Christian, as Bogdan
was, deserved the attention of Lord Stratford.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
In this observation lay the gist of all the evil of
the time.</p>

<p>The Whig Government, more or less subservient
to the Manchester school of politics,
wanted, like the governor of Silivri, to prosper
in a worldly point of view, but did not wish to
assume any moral obligation. So long as goods
were sold they did not care anything about the
buyer personally, or as to where his money came
from, provided he did not become bankrupt.
They were equally indifferent as to whom fell
the task of paying twelve per cent interest on the
loans they so freely offered to the Turk, forcing
him to greater and more relentless exactions on
the poor Christian taxpayer for the repayment.</p>

<p>Such policy is as selfish as that of a French
Communard, whose motto is, “After us the
Deluge;” and the deluge <em>did</em> come, sweeping
away the prosperity and comfort of thousands
and thousands of English families who had
trusted to the positive indebtedness of the
British Government to supervise and direct
those to whom they otherwise would not have
trusted their hard-earned savings.</p>

<p>It is useless to speak of <em lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">hatti-humayoums</em>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
<em lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">irades</em>, or any other devices of ambassadors,
signed by a time-serving Sultan for the regeneration
of his subjects. Local laws such as these,
if applied to the people themselves, may fulfil all
their requirements; but foreign suggestions and
foreign pressure require foreign subjects, which
native subjects who are worthy the name will
never become. Neither can you regenerate a
nation by the mere force of will, nor by force of
arms. The people must have an innate feeling
of willing participation to render reforms desirable.</p>

<p>I have had, whilst governor of the district of
Bourgas, a sack brought to me by a Bulgarian
peasant, which contained the head of his own
child, murdered by brigands before his eyes;
yet that peasant, who was mayor of his own
village, and had ample means of at least making
an effort to save it, had never lifted a finger in
its behalf, but now came to me for assistance
towards payment of the ransom he had promised
to save another child he had at home. I ask,
what laws could regenerate the conduct of that
man? Parental love could not even arouse him
to his duty towards his own flesh and blood!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
What chance would foreign devices have to
move him? I do not cite this as a solitary
case, but as one of many similar examples of
degradation which weigh upon a large portion
of the population in Turkey. I have more than
once seen a Turk maltreating a Christian. I
have had the instrument taken out of the hand
of the offender and placed in the hands of the
stricken, then, standing over both, have insisted
upon retaliation. But this was too abstruse a
method for the perception of a Bulgarian. If,
thought he, no doubt, I could really help him,
why not let him <em>murder</em> the Turk? As for
beating, that would still leave his foe alive,
and after my departure the Turk would thrash
him worse than ever. What the Bulgarian told
me in 1854 is applicable now&mdash;“Leave the
Christian alone in the hands of the Turk, and
he will be more despised and ill-governed than
ever.”</p>

<p>The clergy in the East, as might be readily
supposed, offer no fixed standard of morality to
guide the masses, as the following, among many
other cases brought to my knowledge, will
readily prove. When the Emperor Nicholas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
of Russia died, I was then in command of
Western Roumelia; and the clergy of the district,
headed by the Metropolitan of Adrianople,
came officially to ask of me, as a Christian Pasha,
to be allowed to celebrate a Mass for the repose
of the Emperors soul. The ostensible reason
given for this act of public gratitude was the
many acts of solicitude the dead Emperor had
shown for their Church: scarcely an ornament
on their altars, even to the very canonical costumes
which they then had on their backs, but
they were indebted to him for.</p>

<p>This outward demonstration imposed so much
upon me that I told the Metropolitan, and the
other bishops with him, that if they were so
much indebted, why did they not, by some overt
act beyond spiritual regard, show their acknowledgments?
The successor of him whom they so
deeply deplored had ascended the throne. France,
England, and Turkey were in the field against
him, and he had not a friend in the world&mdash;not
even Austria, who owed her very existence to
his father&mdash;that would say a word or lift a finger
in his behalf. Now, at this solemn moment for
the orthodox Church, a universal display in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
favour of Alexander might so impress the Allies
as to eventually bring about a close of the war
without too much sorrow and suffering on the
part of Russia.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan replied, “We have nothing
to offer Russia alive; when she is dead, all we
can do is to offer up prayers for her.”</p>

<p>So much for Christian gratitude in the East&mdash;and
be it remarked that these Vladicas and
Popas were not all Greeks, but many of them
Bulgarians.</p>

<p>I was now on the point of leaving England
once more without the slightest notice having
been taken of the recommendations of General
Sir Harry Smith, General Cathcart, or of the
colonists regarding my services, when it was
suggested by Lord Clarendon, whom I was
going specially to serve, that some sort of
handle to my name would increase the chances
of my being useful to him. The letter of the
noble statesman on this subject, which is still
in my possession, would merit a place, and that
not a low one, amidst a collection of jokes of the
period. Its only fault is that it makes one
laugh on the wrong side of the face. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
parental solicitude of the Foreign Office towards
one of its adopted little children aroused me to
the necessity of belonging to some established
English institution. The Horse Guards, where I
begged my new guardian still to leave me, had
refused to receive me without payment. As a
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pis aller</em>, it was decided that I should be sent to
Windsor Castle; and I must say that, after all
my late tossings about, I had reason to be gratified
at last, for I breathed much more freely
there than in Downing Street&mdash;and I was, besides,
much more kindly treated.</p>

<p>The journey to Windsor Castle was a pleasant
one. I was seated between Lord Palmerston
and Lord Aberdeen; and although the Duke of
Newcastle had assured me that Lord Palmerston
was always so much behind time as never to see
fish on his own table, yet he managed to come
in very strong with the <em>roast</em> for Lord Aberdeen
before we got to Windsor. The quiet old Scotchman
seemed more than once on the point of
“spitting” out a not over-polite expletive in
reply, but, on reflection, he always managed to
bolt it. The two presented such a contrast, that
it appeared to me, a youngster, incredible that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
they could occupy the same political level. The
former amused himself by pumping me out; the
latter required almost a force-pump to get anything
into him. The result might be the same,
but the operation was quite different. I took,
however, special pains during the journey to instil
into the mind of this kilted-petticoat authority
that, although I looked so young, I was really
no novice in the art of war. He was to be my
respondent, or warrantor, for my qualifications
as a knight-bachelor, whatever that may mean.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at the Castle. The
Ministers went to attend a Cabinet Council.
It looked more as if they had been engaged on
some parish business than on the affairs of the
world. I was left alone to promenade up and
down a long corridor, lined with my predecessors
in glory&mdash;knights-dummies in armour. I was
getting tired of my monologues with these iron-jawed
gentry, and beginning to feel some uncomfortable
twinges from an inward monitor
not always easily appeased after a country ride,
when the young Duke of Brabant, the present
King of the Belgians, came up to me and asked
if I was Captain Lakeman from the Cape. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
said that the Duke of Newcastle had told him
of my presence; and he added, I would no
doubt easily excuse his anxiety to know all
about the Dutch colonists, in whom his father
also took the warmest interest. I was relating
to him, in as few words as possible, all I knew
about the sturdy Dutchmen, with whom I also
claimed a common descent, when a most solemn-looking
personage came up and told me to
follow him. After a warm shake-hands, which
the young duke honoured me with, I followed
the gentleman in black as gravely as though
this had been my last farewell on earth. He led
the way to a small side door, and opening it as
a church-beadle opens a pew, beckoned me to
enter. I bowed, and walked in. It was a small,
oak-panelled room, in the middle of which stood
a Lady surrounded by sedate-looking men. I
felt as if a mistake had been made,&mdash;that I had
got into the manorial enclosure instead of the
strangers’ pew,&mdash;and was on the point of bowing
myself out again, in the humblest way possible,
as a proof of my unintentional intrusion,
when the Lady mentioned smiled so kindly that
I left off bowing and walked further on. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
was no necessity to tell me now that I was in
the presence of the Queen. <em>I felt that I was.</em>
Whatever may be often thought nowadays of
“such divinity as doth hedge monarchs,” I for
my part was ready at once to acknowledge that
fealty to England’s ruler which, hitherto, I had
only offered to the dear country itself. After a
few words had passed, a cushion was brought
and laid before me, and then another, on which
there was a heavy-looking sword. Some one behind
me whispered that I was to kneel&mdash;an operation
by no means agreeable to a man before
company. This I somewhat awkwardly did, and
so remained, with my face bent towards her
Majesty’s feet, expecting every moment to feel
the weight of the sword on my shoulder to indicate
that the ceremony had begun, but nothing
came. There was a dead silence. So I looked
up and saw the Queen holding up the sword
and directing an inquiring glance towards some
one behind my back. Whoever that person was,
he seemed to be a long time in answering. It
was the Earl of Aberdeen. It was evident to
me that her Majesty could not hold the sword
over my head much longer. I asked what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
wanted. “Your Christian name,” her Majesty
said. “Stephen,” I replied; and down came
the sword, missing the shoulder and striking the
cushion. The ceremony, however, was complete
without that, for her Majesty immediately
said, “Arise, Sir Stephen,” and held out her
hand to kiss. I did kiss it, and felt in doing
so that she had not many in her wide realm
who would serve her more devotedly than I
if necessity required it.</p>

<p>The cushions were removed; the Queen graciously
smiled to all around and left the room,
and we retired together through the long corridor
before mentioned. I was standing near
the entrance to the Castle door whilst the Earl
of Clarendon was lighting a cigar, when the
Duke of Newcastle rejoined us, and said, “Allow
me to congratulate you as Sir Stephen Lakeman,
and as to having your head still on. I thought
at one time her Majesty was going to cut it off.”
“Ah,” said Lord Clarendon, puffing away at his
cigarette, which I thought extremely unbecoming
in the Castle, “if the Queen had given it a
whack it would have done it good.”</p>

<p>“Just as it might do your lordship to whack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
out your cigarette,” I replied. I had, within the
last few days, taken a sudden dislike to his lordship,
which, however unaccountable at the time,
was a true presentiment of our future relations.
His Grace of Newcastle took me by the arm and
led me away. He at the same time informed
me that I was to remain at the Castle: a certain
person, whom he pointed out, would attend
to my wants, and I might freely answer any
questions that would be put to me during the
afternoon.</p>

<p>When I returned to town that night, I was
grateful for the honours that had been bestowed
upon me at the request of the Cape colonists.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
